Question: How many nationas are there in the League over time:

Reading in list of nationations in the League. Data from wikipedia
```{r}

members_raw <- read.csv("membership_overview.csv", sep = ";", na.strings = c("NA", "")) 

members = members_raw[c(-4,-43),] #removing meta text cols

```

Data frame showing number of member states in the League
```{r}
per_year <- sapply(members, function(x) sum(!is.na(x))) 

year <- str_replace_all(names(per_year), "X","")

per_year <- data.frame(per_year, year) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.Date(paste0(year, '-01-01')))


write.csv(per_year, "nations_per_year_df.csv")
```
