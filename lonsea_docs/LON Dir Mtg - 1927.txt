MINUTES OP DIRECTORS1 MEETING
Held, on Wednesday, January 19th, 192 7 at 3«30 p«ra.
Present:	The SECRETARY-GENERAL
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL Professor ATT0LICO Me DUPOUR PER ONCE Me COMERT M. CATASTINI M. JACK LIN M. AGEITIDSS M. HAAS
Mr. McKinnon wood Captain MAJKENET Me STOPPANI
Mr. WALTERS (Secretary).
1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL opened the meeting by expressing
his pleasure at seeing LI. Dufour Peronce at it for the first time. He gave him a cordial welcome on behalf of the Secretaria and expressed his confident hope that his presence would add a further contribution to the work done in common in the Secretariat
on behalf of the league.
He regretted that personal reasons had made it impossible for M. Sugimura, who had also recently ¿joined the
Secretariat as Under Secretary-General, to be present at that meeting.
M. DUPOUR thanked the Secretary-General and the meeting
for its good wishes and hopes which he warmly reciprocated
2
2	.	The SSCJKü'PAR Y-GISITELMX said that he believed this
was the first meeting of the year and he might therefore
take a brief survey of the work of the coming months»
The Agenda of the March Council meeting so far as
it could be definitely foreseen at present was net yet very substantial. The questions of chief importance were, first, the question of safety of communications in the Saar, on which a supplementary report had been asked for from the Governing Commission, and secondly, the postponed questions in connection with mandates. He thought it might bo advisable to send an unofficial reminder to the In rope an representatives of the more distant mandatory Powers of the fact that these questions would be discussed in March• (LI. CMTAMHITI agreed with this suggestion. He added that he had just prepared a note on the general subject of how to afford the distant mandatory sowers adequate opportunity of knowing when questions of interest to them would be discussed in the Council and if necessary ananging to be represented).
Apart from the above questions the Secretary-General said that nothing of especial interest could :t present be foreseen for the Council. He hoped that the outstanding points of difference between Germany and the Allies on the question of German disarmament would be duly settled without reference to the Council.
3.	He was rather struck by the large number of Committee
meetings on the programme of the neat three months which were to be held outside Geneva. Two Committees of the C.I.C.I.
were
3
meeting in Paris during the present month, These were probebly less expensive and more convenient in Paris than in Geneva. Then there were three meetings in connection with Disarmament; a meeting of Experts of Civil aviation in Brussels, a Committee for the ^tudy ox article 11 of the Covenant in London, a Committee of Experts on Budgets in Paris. The second of these in particular he felt ought really to have been in Geneva. Article 11 was of immense importance in the constitution of the League ana the best
equipped Committee was like ly to need to consult documents which would be more readily available here than in London.
The subject was such an important one that if possible he thought he should, attend the meeting himself and a representative of the Legal Section should also be there. .
M. AVEITOL and Professor AT TOT ICO strongly agreed; the latter asked whether it would not be possible to persuade Lord Cecil and M. . fitu lesco to come to Geneva for
the meeting.
The S3CH3TABY-G315DEAL promised to write to Lord Cecil but without much hope of success..
M. AGHLIDES drew attention to the special interest of the Political Section in the study of Article 11.
M. COMEET said that in general from the journalistic point of view it was impossible to do justice to the work ox • such meetings when held outside Geneva. A journalist who had not followed the previous discussions could not possibly grasp the real character ox its work.

1. The meeting considered the "Draft Provisional Agenda for the Porty-forth Session of the Council" which had been distributed (Annex). Certain changes were suggested which it was agreed that Mr.Buxton should reproduce in a revised agenda.
The following observations were made with regard to certain items:
Item 2. "Ratification ox Agreements and Conventions concluded under the auspices of the League. Report by the Secretary-General" :
Ho i*eport would be prepared for the Rapporteur, though it was possible that he might wish to mane some suggestion verbally when the Seeretary-General *s report came before the Council. This also applied tc Item 3. "Legal Position of States which do not pay their
contributions to the League":
-2-
Item 4. "System ox the single transferable vote ard the principle of proportional Representation in connection with the problem of the election of the non-permanent Members of the Council!?
M.SUGEiURA explained that the Korwogran Government had
forwarded a second memorandum which was being distributed to the
Council,
Item 5, Tf Hand at es1':
II.CATASTIMI having said that difficulties were being encountered in the way of printing the minutes of the last session of the Permanent Mandates Commission, the 1AFUTY-ifeCRRI ARY-GMKL'RAL ashed that he should address a Minute on the subject to the Secretary ox the Publications Committee.
Item 5. "Traffic in Opium":
"c) Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Production of Opium in Persia.":
Mr!ALTMRS said that the observations of the Persian Government were expected by the middle of Pebruary. The question would be postponed if they did not arrive before the meeting of the Council.
Item 8. "Settlement of Armenian Refugees":
It was decided that the question of the Rapporteur should be left open.
Item 16. "Loan for the Settlement of Bulgarian Refugees;
Quarterly Report of the League Commissioner and Report of the Financial Committee:"
It was stated that it depended on circumstances whether there would be a report of the Financial Committee.
Item 17. "Report of the Greek Refugees Settlement Commission:"
It was decided that the words "Report of Greek Committee" should be added as a sub-title, with the French Representative as rapporteur.
Item 21.	"International Relief Union: Appointment of the President
of the Conferenee:"
Mr.ROST IHG said that the Council might have to consider a i’e quest from the Free City of Danzig to be invited to this Conference o
s
The DEPUTY-SECRET ARY-GEILSRA1 suggested that the Administrative Commissions Section and the Economic Section should confer on this matter and ascertain whether there were precedents for settling such a question without reference to the Council. Item 22. Danzig: Storing and Transport of War Materials within the Free City,'1
The Adiuinistrative Commissions and Disarmament Sections were asked to confer with regard to this item.
JCtem_23_:L "Private Manufacture of Arms: Date of the Conference."
The DEPUTY - SECRETARY-GEITER A1 said that the Secretary-General s note would explain what had happened at the last session of the Council with regard to this question., and the Rapporteur might make a proposal verbally to the Council.
Item 25. "Agreement regarding the Regime to be applied to German Civil Aviation, with a view to the execution of Article 198 of the Treaty of Versailles,"
The DEPUTY- SECRET ARY- GEiPi Section and Mr.3uxton should confer this item, wnich did not seem exact should be shown to M,Dufour.
EAL asked that the Disarmamen as regards the wording of , The final wording proposed
Item 26o "Request of the Karamorosi Tarsasag Railway Company."
Lie HAAS said that this item might later be withdrawn.
Item. 27. "Appeal concerning the German Minority Schools at
Wilcza-Gorna9 Lazislca-Gorna and Bytkow, under Article 147 of the Upper Silesian Convention."
In reply to the D '.PUTY-SECRETARY-GENERAL, Mr „ROST IMG
explained that the Council would presumably deal with this
question in full session in application of the Upper Silesian
Convention.
-4-
M.COiGRT ashed that there should, he added as Item 28. "The Report of t lie Press Experts Committee",with the Belgian Representative as Rapporteur-*.
Li.HAAS said that the convocation of the Third General Conference on Communications and Transit night later be added to the agenda, in accordance with proposals that might be made by the Transit Committee.
The DEPUTY-SECRETaRY-GEK UAL said that it was desirable that each member of the Council should present at least one report. The agenda as at present drafted provided for no report by the Chinese representative.
He ashed Mr .haliers to enquir, of the Social Section whether
the Chinese representative might not report on Item 8 "Statement of Armenian Refugees”.
The DEPUTY - SECRET TIP/-GE11 ;EA1 reminded Directors that draft reports should,, whenever practicable, be sent to Rapporteurs, and their approval obtained,, in time to allow of the distribution of the reports as early as possi ble before the Council's session.
There were, however, certain reports which could bo prepared only after the session of a committee held just before or at the same time as the session of the Council; these should always be distributed at least twenty-four hours before the meeting of the Council at which they were to bo considered.	moreover, there were
5
certain delicate questions on which Rapporteurs desired to consult their colleagues before issuing their reuort. Sven in these cases it was sometimes possible for a partial report containing the history of the question to be issue! early. that was essential was that the report, when issued, should be given to all ohe members of the Council, and that no preliminary draft for certain members only should be made. It was incumbent upon the Secretariat to ensure, so far as lay within its power, the equality of treatment of members of the Council in this respect«
In renly to id. GaTaSTIIJI , the R. «PUT £~ lirO.uj ..ntf ~
GSR URAL said there was no objection to a Rapporteur issuing a provisional report, provided it was circulated to all the me mbers,

toarrange that the agendas for the separate meetings of the Council session should be distributed to members by 7 p,mu on the preceding evening at the latest. Lid, Walters, Bonnet and Bunt on were ashed to form a committee to consider, after consulting the Sections interested, what practical measurescould be ado;ted to this end.
5.	Id. STOPPaHI suggested that the hands of secretaries of committees should be strengthened by the establishment of a more definite rule that meetings of committees should not be held outside Geneva.

l.(b) Bay sent by the League of ..atioris of expenses connected with the High Comniss iono rT s post at ^anzig: Report by the Supervisory Commission.
The SnCR^T/JfY-G^RBRAL said that on the general question raised by this item the view which the Secretariat had been inclined to tune was that if the work was done for the direct benefit of only two or three .¿embers of the League they should bear the cost, but that if it concerned any considerable number of the members oi the League it should be considered of sufficient general interest to be paid lor by the League,. The Lssenbly, however, seemed inclined to hold that even in the latter case the interested governments should pay. Of course much must depend on ’bother the benefit could be held to be oi general League interest or solely that of particular countries.
2
3» Legal Position of States which do not gay their contributions to the league. Report ~b,y the Secretary-General e
The SLCFAiT ArAT-GLITLBAL hope d that the Eappox tour would propose that the Secretary-General's report should be forwarded to the Assembly as constituting an adequate study of the legal aspects of the question.
4.	System of the single transferable vote and the gr inciple of proportional Representation in connect on with the problem of the election of the non-permancnt i.embers of the Council.
The SACfAjTAhY-GAiAjRAL thought that the Council would probably instruct him to forward to the Assembly the two reports by the horwegian Government together with any memorandum from a recognised authority on the subject ‘"hich might be received.
R
e •
liana ates:
a)	Report of the Permanent ...and at os Commission on the work of its 10th Session.
The SLCRLTARY-GIJII-jRAL thought that the only point in the Commission’s report which might provoke a difficult discussion was the Commission’s criticism of the use of the words "sovereignty subject to the terms of its mandate” used in a recent treaty b;, the South .*frican Government. As no practical interest would be served by making this question the occasion for debating the highly controversial problem of where sovereignty ov~r a mandated territory resides, he hoped that the Council without accepting or rejecting the Commission's criticisms would simply transmit them for information to the ..andater y £ower.
b)	Hearing- of fetitionors.
The SACROTARY-G_j.J_.AAL said that the craft report "‘hich
as being sent to the .mpnortour concluded against the hearing of petitioners by the Commission, but suggested that if the
3
Commission desired further information with regard to a given petition it should he entitled to ash for it from a handat o r y Iowe r.
6.	Traffic in Opium.
a)	Report of the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium.
M. BERG said that the Report of the advisory Committee left it to the Council to decide on f. Cavazsoni's proposal that an extraordinary session of the Committee should ho held this year to consider the questions of the rationing of drugs and of further measures for the suppression of the illicit traffic. The question now arose what the rapporteur should advise the Council to do.
Professor ATTGLICO thought that the Council should take the same view as the majority of the Commission. If the majority of the Comnission had been in favour of the proposal its rejection by the Council might create a bad impression on public opinion.
hi. BERG said that the Committee had refrained from taking a vote on the merits of the proposal.
Dr. lutJCEEAii thought this might be a cast, where the Council should decide by a free vote after hearing a statement by the Committee.
The SECRETARY-GEEEEAL said that he understood that
the feeling of the Committee was against a special meeting to consider the lu^stion of the rationing of drugs, but that if within the next few months important information was received concerning the illicit traffic it was felt that a special meeting might be useful. r reaps the Council should agree tnat if such n„w facts emerged the .resident and Vice-President of the Committee should be authorised to summon a meeting.
4
Piofessox ATJOLICO thought that the Council might even provisionally fin a date for the meeting saying that it was left to the President and Vice-President to summon it for that date if they thou ht that the evidence warranted a special meeting. Phis ns agreed to.
e) Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the cultivation ~~0x ¿hoium Poppy in Persia.
The SECT.3TAP.Y-GENERAL said that the observations of the Persian Government on the report had not yet been received and that if they were net received say ten days before the Council* s session the item should be withdrawn from the agenda.
8. Settlement of Armenian Refugees.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that Mr. Howland had telegraphed to say that the appeal for funds in the United States of America had failed.
10 .Report of the Health Committee.
Dr. RAJCEIvlAN said that the report of the Committee should be ready by Saturday, February 12th. It would deal inter alia with the relations between the Singapore Bureau and the Office international as regards epidemiological intelligence, with the practical relations between the Office International and the Health Co mitten and a Is© with the possible suppression of some of the technical committees of the Health Committee.
12»Saar Basin: Appointment of the Chairman and Members of the ¿overnin.g Commission.
Mr. COLBAM explained that the council v/as free to take a decision concerning the re-appointment or replacement of any of the five members of the Governing Commission and also to decide which of the five snnointsd should be President.

Mr. h.SETSEB said that it was important that the Conference should he held as early as possible and that it should be as representative as possible.
Mr. COLBA1I thought that a transfer might be made nom the budget of his section.
The 33CB3 JàBY-GJr IPd.L asked the Information oection, having noted Mr. Colban's offer, to consider the Question fu rther.
28. Porn of -treaties negotiated in future -under the, avs rices of the league o'f rations:	Statement by the British Representative'.
The 3MCE3TMBY-GEB3:.BL said that this statement would refer to the desire expressed by the recent Imperial Conference of the British 3mpire that International Conventions should in future be drawn up in the names of the heads of states as before the ar rather than in the names of the States only. The British Government attach*! much importance to this Question and even doubted whether it could become a party in future to Conventions not drawn up in the way pro:osed.
I.	The 33CR3TÆY-GM1I3R.A.L said that as far as he could
•
see the Council should be able to get through its work meeting only once a day, preferably in the afternoon. There would be enough to keep it busy the first two days, but there might he not enough re >orts ready for a meeting on the third day, when

The ofCMfTiJiY~CTITTRAL said that he wished the meeting in London of the Committee on Article --I, of which there were only three members, to he attended hy as few members of the oecretariat as .possible . It would look b^-d if there was a large staff connected with such a small committee.
The SDC1.VTMEY-T-dMT-i..Mi said that he was going to London for the last week in February and world he happy to discuss with the British Government any questions which the

1.	The Heetine considered tlie order of items of the
provisional agenda for the Forty-fourth Session of the Council* (Directors Eeeting Paper 2).
Certain ohanges v:e. e made which Hr. Guilt on was ashed to embody in the ne::t issue of the ay on da.
In connection with this iton, the following discussions also t oolt plaoe :
It op 3. Ratification of Agreements and Conventions concluded under the Auspices of the League:
The 3EPUTY SECRETARY GHtTTlHfL thought that tho cramination by the Council of thi3 item night he made the occasion for a statement hy the Rapporteur on the subject of accession of conventions subject to ratification. The Swiss Government had drawn attention to the fact that this somewhat irregular practico seemed now to bo followed by some Eenl-ers of the League, and the Council night thin.- it right in convoking future
conferences to lay down that accession made subi-ôt to ratification, would not be registered by the ¿Secretariat.
The Seoretary-General thought that it might be better if the Rapporteur mentioned the question but proposed that it should be referred to the Assembly.
Item gO fb) Report of the Commission of Snouiry into the Cultivation of Opium Poppy in Persia.
fame Rachel CROWDY said that a representative of the Persian Government would make before the Council a statement regarding the policy of his Government in this matter.
The actual observations of the Persian Government on the Report of the Commission had not vet arrived. Presumably the Council would decide to reconsider the question in •June, after the Rercrt and the observations had both been circulated.
The Meeting considered the question of the disclosure of non-published information concerning the Council to national parliaments and Press by members cf the Council. (Confidential Circular 4, 1927).
The SECRET ARY- GENERAL said that though this question was not within the competence of the Secretariat, it might be useful if Directors agreed on the kind of reuly which should be made if they were asked for their opinion.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed on the whole wi th the view put forward as a basis for discussion in the document circulated.	The meetings of the Council
-3~
wore of throe kinds, public, private or secret. 3y consenting to meet in priveto, end still more in secret, the mombors of the Oouncil implicitly undortook to pro serve by their discretion the private or secret character oí the meeting. It seomed to him that a member pas not at liberty to discloso the attitude of his colleagues at such ? mooting, though he might in certain circumstances be compelled to ospla in what his o’«n position had been.
M. de	wondered whether he could do this with-
out also referring to the position of other members.
The Meeting thought that ‘ñín could.
M. CAT„oTIhI said that casos might also arriso in which a member of a eaguo Committoe might bo tempted to spoak in public of discussions of the Committee which had not yet boon reviewed by the Council.
The oECRIrl'sRY-Ghihhgi thought tnst it should be easy to forego such a temptation by explaining that the deliberations ck the Committee were confidential until the Council had taken noto of thom.
The Mooting considered the cuestión of future invitations to the U.d.o.R. (Directors .00tin' Paper ho.l) .
a
Professor rTTOHCO said that there was an alternative course not mentioned in the paver circulated, namely, that the Council should in future ref re in from taking any action with regard to an invitation to the U. --.C.R. to conferences hold in Switzerland. The mat tar propo seel in the pe_ or was rocliy an indirect invitation and to make such was, in the eircum stances, dignity of the eaguo.

The DEPUTY SECRL.lVi.IiY G_,ILVU-L thought that this Was much more a political question than a question of procedurei In deciding on the convocation of any conference, the Council agreed by name on the btatos non-LIembers oi the League to be invited, would it not be better to wait until it was next balled upon to issue invitations to a conference and consider the question of the U.b.b.n. each time it arose?
bir Arthur SALTER said that this would mean a political discussion on the Russian question each time that the Council decided to convoke a conference.
The oEC^uiTARY-G^H^VJ.L said that the secretariat could h. rdly avoid considering the problem, as it v.culd certainly be consulted by rapporteurs. There war no need to formulate a rule, but he was inclined to accept the suggestion made in
»
the paper, at any rate as regards technioal conferences.
This was generally agreed to.
4. Mr. JACKLIH asked Sections, in drawing up their sectional budgets for 1928, to remember the recommendation passed by the fourth Committee of the Assembly at its last session, that an effort should be made to stabilise the budget of the League at the figure for 1927. He congratulated the sections on the very real efforts they had made to effect economies in their expenditure lor the past year.

The meeting considered the proposals made "by the Secretariat Committee set up to examine the question of the procedure of the opening of the Assembly (Confidential Circular 1 1927).
- 2
C ommi t tee's pr onosals, which w cm Id ce rtainly sh or ten the
time scent on formalities at the opening of the Assembly. Their practicability, however, seemed to depend on whether it was desirable for the speech by the Acting President of the Council to take place at the beginning of the debate on the work of the Council instead of at the omening of the Assembly.
speech at the opening of the Session afforded the only opportunity for a widely advertised review of the work of the League as a whole for the past year.
still be the first big speech and would therefore have the same publici ty.
the speech by the -¡-'resident of the Council should be spoken by him not as being accidentally the man to open the Assembly1 s session, but as the spokesman of the Council before the Assembly.
Sir Arthur SALTAR thou
t that the de livers of the
Professor ATTOIICO said that under the new
The Deputy Secretary-General and others condemned
as heretical
looking at the cuestión from the
point of view of distant
countries, preferred the present
practice« At the very openin' of the Session an important speech was now made: this was telegraphed all over the world and pe ople .realised that the Assembly of the league had o ened, and that the league was functioning formally. Ho other method of opening the Assembly would be so emphatic,
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GrSlhSEAl said that the same publicity and emphasis could be given to the speech if, as now proposed, it was held on the Tuesday afternoon instead of on the MorAay morning.
M. CC&I3KT thought that if the first day vías occupied only in formalities the journalists would come only on the second day.
The SECBE JAEY-GEI! ERA I , summing up, said that there was no doubt that the new system would present advantages, namely, that the formalities of the opening fin which should be included the meetings of the Committees to constitute their bureaus: - not mentioned in the proposal) could be finished in a day and a half, and the debate on the work of the Council could so begin on Tuesday afternoon: the speech by the Acting President of the Council would then be delivered at a time when delegates were prepared to listen to it, which was not the case at present as everyone was thinking of elections to the presidency and the General Committee: lastly the speech would give a good opening for the debate on the work of the Council, and thus remove the difficulty which recurred every Session of finding someone to open the debate.
On the other hand, he
attached, great weight to ougimura * s oh Sections. He therefore asked Ur. -»'alters to c rvene the Committee again in order to consider vhether an alternative plan could not he drawn up which would, make the same saving of time and yet allow fcr the o'ening speech by the President of the Council to he delivered at the beginning of the Bessicn, as at present. .* choice between the two alternatives could be made later.
The 3fCEfTi£Y~GffIT IRhX said that he had been instructed by the Council to study and report tc it on the question whether it would be practicable to held regularly three Sessions of the Council instead of four.
Before drawing up his report he would ask sections
IT* JT.'r
heir views cn the proposal. Subject to any serious difficulties which sections might bring to his notice, he
thought the proposal a gcod one. It would make it easier for the foreign ministers of the big European Powers to come tc the meetings cf the Council. They were finding it difficult
to c oae	as	often as four times a	year,	and if one	they
started	to	send sub stitu tes they	v ou Id	be tempted	"t 0 30x1
substitutes regularly. Their presence at Geneva had greatly enhanced the prestige of the Teague, and their absence would in future diminish it. Secondly, with less frequent meetings of the Council it would be easier for overseas ccuntiies represented on the Council tc send responsible ministers to its sessions instead of accredited representatives here. Moreover, under the new system it would be less embarrassing to convoke smedal meetings of the Council than at present. The
objection
t
5
which might he made was that the progress of the leaguers work might he retarded, This objection might a pply to certain of the Leagued work but not, he thought, tc its technical work, where the end cf the Teague’s efforts was principally to secure action by the governments of all its Members. It had perhaps not be on sufficiently realised in the |>ast that 'his very universality of the Teague’s v; rk enacted as its price a certain slowness which would not be necessary if the Teague were a purely European institution.
If the proposal were accepted the following changes would be necessary:
1.	float the Council should meet a little earlier before
the oession of the Assembly and remain f*r a day or two after :
2.	That authority should be sought from the -Assembly to amend the financial regulations so that, after approval by the Supervisory Commission, the budget need not be submitted to the Council but could bo- sent forthwith to the Members of the
he a gue
[ a r a s
he coul see, the most suitable dates for
the Council sessions would then be the third week in January, the sec end week in May, end September .
Sir Arthur SAT THE put forward a conservative view as follows: while realising the advantages to the Teague of

temporary reasons, thcuch, if it were later found, for sound
and permanent rea	s ens 5	the t	thrse m stings	were on'trh the
change c ou 1 d saf e	ly be	made	. Personally,	he felt that if
foreign ministers	were	to r	e'■ ard heneva as	the n orme 1 wince
for cli sen s sine with each other their various problems, not only League problems, the time the7 spent at Geneva under the four-session system was nc't too much. As regards the impression for the public which the change would make, anxiety was already felt that the work of the Assembly was being hustled by the Council, and anxiety might now be felt the work of the Council was being hustled by the Locarno Powers
The work of the Economic section would hot have suffered sensibly in the past year under a three-session system but it would have in former years, ana it might also suffer after the Economic Conference» In any case, in dune and September of the present year the normal ¿sessions of the Gounci must be held. He thought, therefore, that it would be better
if the decision was taken only in September.
Perhaps as a c empromise the foreign minis vers could
come themselves to three Sessions and send substitutes frr one
Professor ^TTOIICO did not like Sir Arthur Salter’s last suggestion, for substitutes would always be sent. He generally agreed with the Secretary-General, and felt that the change was desirable not on transitory but on permanent grounds
a. CQEJ1.T said that the publicity which the League received would certainly surfer as a result of the change. On the other hand, he thought that the Question had been decided in favo: r of the change bp soon as it had been put, as the members of the Council would be only too pleased to come only
7
three times a year. -all the Secretariat had to do, therefore, was tc adjust itself accordingly.
II.	DUIOUB also agreed that the Council would ¿tnost certainly accept the proposal.
Dr. hdJCHlLiTK thought that the motives of the change would certainly he Questioned in those countries which took
the work of the League seriously. She original decision to hold four regular meetings of the Council had had a most salutary effect. Ee wondered whether in a matter of such

replied that this was ow n c om pe t e n c e .
fhe bfCllffaEY-Gr3i"gE^.L said that if the bee: advanced strong administrative objections to the change, the Council would hardly insist on making it. In the present
discussion, however, he had not been convinced by the arguments against the change, 3o far from agreeing that it was dictated by temporary considerations, he felt that it was re_lly a sign of the settling down of the work of the league to something like its normal pice. It should be remember 'd that the Covenant had provided for a meeting of the Council "at least once a ye-r" . fhe publicity argument destroyed itself, as if the foreign ministers did not come to the Council there would be hardly any

1.	Mr. MCKINNON WOOD gave certain information concerning
the present session of the Committee for the Progressive Codification of International Law. On seme subjects the Committee would probably wish to consult governments as a next step. On certain others, governments had already been asked whether, in their opinion, it was time to draw up international conventions. The Committee might therefore propose to the Council the summoning of a conference to deal with such subjects as were deemed ready for international conventions.
The SSCESTMEY-GENERAL said that there was no urgency for the meeting of such a confer-nee, and it would be better if none met in 1928, as the Disarmament Conference might almost monopolise the energies of the Secretariat. He was inclined to
think that it might be better if a c'edification conference were
summoned by some State under the auspices of the league, rather than by the Council itself.
II. HAAS said that the technical organisations
of the Tea rue would be to
some eut:
subjects deemed ripe for conventions, and he hoped that

In reply to a question II. de 1IADARIAGA said that the Spanish Government■had decided not to be represented at the Economic Conference on the ground that that Conference was political.
Sir Arthur SALTEE observed that the Government of the United States of America had decided to be represented at the Economic Conference on the ground that it was not political.
II. de MADARIAGA gave an outline of the procedure which the Preparatory Committee would probably follow for the present session.
Sir Arthur SAT TER suggested that married officials might be given the option of receiving their fare home for themselves and their wives once in two years, instead of the fares for themselves only each year.
The SECRETASY-SEFERAI said that he would ask the

M. de LIADAEIAGA dren attention to the unsuitability of the Paris Office for meetings, owing to the noisiness of the ne i gh o curh o od .
The DTPUTY S3CE3I'ARY-G3IUÜRAL thought that the temptations for C omeiissions to meet in Paris should not he increased.
Sir Arthur SALTS!: considered that it was of more immediate importance to have a really competent hi-lingual stenographer in the Paris Office.
II. HAAS thought that the same was true of the London Office.

The SECRETARY-GENERAL welcomed the Marquis Paulucci.
The Marquis PAULUCCI, thanking the Secretary-General, expressed his pleasure at taking up his duties in the Secretariat. His task would be difficult, as he was new to the work, but he felt he could rely on the help of his colleagues» They, for their part, could count on his sincere collaboration.
The SECEETAKY-GEIIEEAI. reminded Under-Secretaries General and Directors who had not submitted their observations on the question of holding three Council meetings a year (Minutes of Directorsr Meeting 1G6, March 16th, Item 2.) to do so as soon as possible.

5.	Tile SSC'RluTMti-drElERAL said that in the next few days
he would wish to disouss the budget with the Sections concerned^ He hoped the work would be finished by the next Tuesday.
4.	LI, HAAS described the steps which had been taken by
the Transit Committee with regard to the improvement of telephonic and telegraphic communications with Geneva,
As rega.ds telephonic communications, various experiments had been made. Conversations had been held successfully with the three Scandinavian capitals3 Further experiments would be made in conversing with Vienna, Prague and Warsaw. He hoped that communic -tions with London, at present bad, would be improved in the course of the year. It was doubtful whether, for reasons of expense, satisfactory arrangements could be made for telephonic communications with South-Eastern Haropc. As regards Home, the Swiss Government was in principle prepared to arrange for a special line to the Italian frontier.
Liarquis PAULUCCI said that the Italian Government was in favour of completing the line on the Italian side, and asked that II, Haas should encuire whether, in view of the attitude of the two kvernments, the new line could not definitely be made.
On the question whether the Secretariat should have a T, S.F. station of its own, continued Li. HAAS, certain technical enquiries were now being made. He hoped that, when the Assembly met, it would be possible to present alternative plans for stations, the messages of which should be :
1} received all over the world, though in distant countries messages might not be received at all times of the day;

2)	received by all Europe, 1Jew York and Buenos Ayres at all times, and at -ether places at specified times;
3)	received all over Europe,
In reply to the SECREIAPY-G-EHSRAJL, EL HAAS said that the cost of the installation should not exceed one, or at the most, tor-’ million Swiss francs., The cost cf upkeep was small in proportion to the initial outlay.
It was observed that the possession of such a station mould, in any case, bring a big saving in the cost of telegrams, which, especially when circular telegrams were sent to overseas Members cf the league, was very heavy.

1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that n»st of the Under-
score taries-General and Directors had nèw sent in to him their opinions on the proposed reduction ef the number of the Council sessions to throe. These opinions were agreed that the change would entail no serious administrative inconvenience, with a possible exception in the case of the w*rk of the Financial Committee. On general grounds there was opposition to the change. He himself thought this opposition was based largely on an unsound premise, namely, that the present system cf f«ur meetings a year could still be maintained, with the foreign ministers attending all four »r at least three meetings.
He proposed in his report to the Council to say that the change would seem to involve no administrative difficulties except as regards the Financial Committee, and that the extent of this difficulty the Council
-2-
would itself be better able to judge in a few months1 time.
He would add that, as he had been instructed to report only on the administrative side of the question, he would not enter in detail into the possible effect of the change on the bigger interests of the League such as the importance of frequent Geneva meetings from the point of view of general discussions between Statesmen which it was for the Council itself to consider. Finally, he would propose that, as the Council would be renewed in September, and as it would be the new Council that would be affected t$r any change, the final decision might be left till then.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL thought that the procedure set forth by the Secretary General was wise. The proposal to postpone the final decision for a few months would enable public opinion to declare itself, and would also give greater guarantees that the final decision, whatever it was, would be taken in the general interests of the league and not for the temporary convenience of some of the Council members.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER wondered whether it would not be advisable to say that the change would involve a certain slowing down of the general work of the League.
The SECRETARY GENERAL said that he would think about this, but that he felt that if he were to say so he should also add his conviction that in the past the League had often, especially in its technical work, attempted to advance at a pace with which many Members of the League, handicapped by their distance from Geneva, could not keep up..
Sir ARTHUR SALTER asked whether it would not be wiser for the Secretary-General to be rather more neutral in his
-3-
repnrt 1?> the June session, and "to promise a supplementary report for September. The proposal was indeed officially public, but in fact, owing to various circumstances, it had not received any wide publicity. He doubtexi whether public opinion should be given so strong a lead as the ’course proposed by the Secretary-General would give it.
The SECHETÂRY-GENERAI said that, as he had stated, he would give no lead on the political side of the question, but on the technical side he saw no reason to hedge, as all were agreed that the proposal was technically feasible. However, the matter was largely one of presentation.
Mr. CO LEAN thought that, as the question would appear on the agenda of the Council, the lost publicity would be recaptured in good time.
Mr. JACK LIN reminded the S ecre ta ry-General that the change would involve a modification of the present practice as regards discussion of the Budget by the Council.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that this was another reason for postponing the final decision until September.
The SECEETAPY-GENSEAL also thanked M. SUGIMUHA for a reminder that his report should perhaps emphasise the need for ensuring the possibility of convoking special sessions of the Council at least as easily a3 before.
2.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was most desirable
to know before the Easter holidays whether the session of the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference would be prolonged beyond the date for the opening of the Economic
-4-
Conferenoe, as in that case special arrangements for committee rooms and staff would have to be made.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER 3aid that he expected that the Committee demands of the Economic Conference would not reaoh their height before May 9th.
M. MADARIAGA said that everything inclined him to
pessimism as regards the duration of the session of the
Preparatory Committee. It was hard to believe that it would
not sit beyond May 1st.., Perhaps, however, the end might come
before May 9th. Immediately before Easter the Bureau of the Commission would meet to consider the situation,,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed that this was the proper course.
3„	The SECRETARY-GEE ERA! said that the Budget for
1928, of which the Secretariat examination was now finished, showed an increase of seme 500,000 francs, of which 200,000 were due to circumstances over which the Secretariat had no control. The surplus for 1926 was 1,300,000 francs, which would have to be returned to Members so that, in accordance with expectations, their contributions for 1920 should not exceed those for 1927.
4S	Mr. SWEETSER said that twenty-five carefully selected
American editors were coming to Geneva for the next session of the Assembly,
5„	Mr. McKIEEON-WOOD said that the session of the
Codification Committee had come to an end, Certain subjects were being submitted to the Council as ripe for treatment by international conferences. On others the opinions of Governments

The meeting considered the draft provisional agenda of the Eighth Session of the Assembly. (Directors* Meeting Paper Do.4.).
Itam 7, Slavery Convention: Annual Report by the Council.
The SECRET.'IRY-GEHERAL said that the Council would not be in a position formally to adopt this report before its September session, but that, in accordance with the authority regularly sought from it at its June session, the draft report would presumably be communicated to the Members of' the League at the same time as to the Council.
Item 13, Report on the Work of the Economic and Financial
Organisation, etc.

Assently on this item would merely be the relevant extract from the June report on the work of the Council; though the Economic Committee was always desirous of submitting a separate report to the Assembly.
Item 14. International Economic Conference-: Report on the Work of the Conference.
After a long discussion whether this item should be included forthwith in the agenda, or whether the Council should be asked to include it in the supplementary list of items, it was agreed that it should be included in the present agenda under the heading of "Items inserted by the assembly at its Seventh Session", which r'oula be changed to "Items inserted by the Assembly, or arising out of Assembly Decisions.."
Item 21. Conference for the Reduction and limitation of Armaments: Report on the Worjfc of the Preparatory Committee.
It was agreed that this item should be removed from the agenda. The subject would be dealt with in the general report on the work of the Council, and the assembly would presumably decide to refer that part oi the Report to the Third Committee.
In reply to Id. de KADARIAGA, the SEC WET AH Y- OE HERA L said that he thought the question of the private manufacture Of arms should he dealt with in the same way, and should not be placed on the agenda. .
Iftem 22, Ratification of Agreements concluded under the ¿auspices of the League.
Mr. liCZIIIHOE WOOD said that there was no occasion for this item to appear on the agenda, but that it might be
3
replaced by the question of accessions to conventions subject to ratification.
Items £-3 and 24.	23. Questions relating: to the rapid working
of the organs of the League in case of emergency.
Proposal by the Committee of the Council.
24. Collection of information regarding th e econo:iic and financial relations of the various States with a view to a possible application of Article 16 of the Covenant: Report by the Secretary-General,
On the suggestion of U. do UAJJARIAGA, it eras agreed that an item divided into sub-headings should be drafted, including items 23 ana 24 and the report of the Committee of the Council on the application of Article 11. The redra: t mould be put before the next Directors1 Heating.
Item 25. Pudget for 19 28, etc.
The 5DCRDTARY-GDIHRAL ashed Ur. Jacklin to consider whether the sub-heading "Result of League Building Competition Report of the Jury of Architects" should be retained on the agenda or not.
Item 26,. Appointment of throe non-pcmanent members of the Council.
On the suggestion of Mr. UCKIiiSOU WOOD, it was agreed that this item should follow Item 5, and that the heading, "Other Items” should accordingly disappear.
On -the suggestion of Sir Arthur SALTER, it was agreed that the question of the competence of the League should be inserted under the heading of "Items inserted by the Assembly, or arising out of As s emb ly De c i s io ns " .
4
In repl;> to Mr* L'OZINiiOD WOOD, the SEOliiiTDBY-GSKEiEAL said that the question of the progressive oodification of international law would presumably be placed by the Council on the supplementary list of items*
It was agreed that when the agenda was submitted to the President of the Council, the inclusion of certain items which might be considered as doubtful should be explained to him, so that he could, should he think: right, obtain confirmation of his decisions from his colleagues*
2*	It was agreed to postpone until the last Directors’
Meeting before the June session of the Council the question of procedure at the opening of the Assembly*
3„	The SECRET ARY-CSHLRAL referred to a certain feeling of
depression which was being felt in some League circles*
This had been provoked by the fact that the machinery of the League had not been used in the Chinese crisis and in the more recent crisis regarding Albania, and had. been increased by the disagreement on fundamental points of the Preparatory Committee of the Disarmament Conference* He himself was disposed to agree that the League was going through a bad period, but it had gone through several considerably worse* As regards the first two questions, it seemed to him a matter of opinion whether it would in fact have been in the general interest for the machinery of the League to be used. Some partisans of the League were apt to forget that, provided international disputes were settled by peaceable means, it did not matter very much by what machinery they were settled. If these disputes were to lead to crises of a more serious kind, they would presumably be brought before the League, but until such
5
dises arose, it was not necessarily to be regretted that an attempt was being made to settle them by direct negotiations.
M* DUFOTJH EnHQlTCE agreed that the non-use of the League in the case of China end Albania was much less damaging to it than was the present disarmament crisis.
He, himself, though his country had every reason to desire the speediest possible progress in this matter, felt that the friends of the League should not be unduly disappointed if the progress now achieved was United, provided it was real, and was accepted as merely a first step.
Sir Arthur SALTHH drew attention to the interesting precedent established by the ¿ritish Government in the Chinese affair. Though that Government had felt that this question was not one that could be suitably brought before the League at the moment, it had sent a full statement of its policy to the members of the League, thereby recognising that the League had an interest in it.
The SEC LETAB Y - GBHERAL agreed that this was a useful step to take, but he felt that communications of this kind should be for the information of the I.embers of the League only, and should not be placed on the agenda of the Council.
To place then on the agenda would, in fact, involve the League as deeply as if the question had been formally referred to the League under the Covenant, and it was assumed that, in the given case, such n reference was
undesirable
6
liar qui s PAULUCCI associated himself with the statement made by the Secretary-General that the League's machinery should not necessarily be employed in every international dispute. This fact was not sufficiently realised by public opinion. As regards communication of a statement of policy for the information of the L'embers of the League, referred to by Sir Arthur Salter, this was undoubtedly a wise thing to do in certain circumstances, but it should be for the Government concerned to decide in a particular case what action was in the interests of the League and of world peace.

1.	The agenda of the 8th Assembly was again examined.
Certain drafting changes were made and a decision taken as t* the text of the item relating to the oh ligation of members of the league to facilitate the meeting of the Council in times of crisis. This text relates exclusively to the recommendation of the Committee of the Council cn that subject, but it was understood that the other questions dealt with by that Committee at the seme time would be set forth in the general resorts to the Assembly, and that any delegation could ask that they be refQrre I to the consideration of the 3rd Committee.
On M. Comert's suggestion it was decided to add a note to the effect that the order in which the questions figure on the agenda did not prejudge the order in which they would actually
be taken*
2
2.	The Secretary-General sail that the Supervisory
Committee vas meeting next week. It would deal, amongst other things with the Auditor's report for 1526 and the Budget proposals for 1928 . He had seen the auditor’s report which did not raise any points of serious difficulty. As for the Budget estimates, he had not seen the Rapporteur's remarks, hut he understood that he called attention to an increase of about 3 per cent., and that he expressed the view that it was no use trying for a lump decrease and that the supervisory Committee must gu through the Budget item by item. The Secretary-General observed that recent events had probably made possible an immediate reduction of 200,000 francs in one i taa.
He hoped that Directors would, as far as possible, be present at the meetings of the Supervisory Committee at which their section bud rets were dealt with.
Mr. Jscklin said that the Rapporteur referred especially to two subjects,
(a) increase of staff,
fb) expenditure on printing;
Directors should, therefore, be prepared to be asked Questions especially cn these points.
The Secretary-General thought that the Committee would not insist very much in regard to printing expenditure.
He was expecting a report from K. avenol on the conslusions of the Committee on league Publications, cf which he was Chairman.
As for staff increase, the whole situation in regard to the increased work of the secretariat would be set out in a report which was being prepared on the Council's instructions.
3
Mr. Huston had prepared a first draft of this report. It would, he thought, have to deal mainl/ with the work of the Central Services which was a natural reflection of the work of the Sections. One or two Sections whose work had notably increased, e.g., the Disarmament Section and the Economic and Financial Section might also he taken as examples* Figures of Committee Meetings, etc., would also he given.
3.	The Secretary-General said that the U.S.S.X.- Swiss agreement had come as a surprise to hi: . He did not think that any formal action could he taken by the Secretariat in
0
the sense of renewing the invitations refused to the U.S.-j.K. Government. The invitations, of course, stood, and could he accepted by that Government if it so wished.
4.	Dr. Homan White said that his journey to a conference at Melbourne had, he thought, been useful, though inevitably
a very large amount of time was lost in travelling. It had been followed by visits to a number of Pacific Islands, Samoa, Fiji, Tongo Island, Cook Islands, etc. He had studied the health work being done there, and also in Australia and Hew Zealand. As a result of the Conference, he thought that some useful work of ccoordination could be done by the Health Organisation. He had addressed meetings on the League in Australia .and Hew Zealand and found the audiences very much interested and very sympathetic though lacking in know;ledge of League affairs.
5.	The ordinary work of the Health Section was at present very heavy. Hext week would be held a Rabies Conference in
Paris which looked like being exceedingly good from the technical
point of view. Immediately after that a meeting of the Office International d'Hygiene Publique, which would deal with the proposals for co-ordination drawn up by the Health Committee at its meeting in February. This might possibly take some time .
Hr. Huston said that the Jury cf Architects was going on very slowly. They had got down the 365 plans to 56. It was hardly possible that they would reach decisions in time for the exhibition to be held before the 1.1*0. Conference in Hay. If it were held after that Conference, the extra expenditure would not be very great.
M. Comert urged, and others strongly supported the proposal, that after the prize-winning design had been selected a meeting should be held in public, at which the envelopes containing the names of the prize winners should be opened.
The Secretary-General and Llarquis Paulucci agreed.
Hr. Huston said that he would submit the question to the Jury .
M. Haas said that further work had been done in the matter of direct telephone communication. An attempt had been made to converse with \ far saw via Vienna.. It was not very successful, but this had been anticipated and improvements were in hand, as a result of which better communications might be hoped for.
The Swiss Administration had consented to the suggestion made by the Italian authorities for a direct line

8.	M. cLe Madariaga said that the Drafting Committee of
the Commission on the Private Manufacture of Arms had met the previous day. Results had not been very clear and would probably have to be set forth in two columns, one representing the views of these countries which desired to exclude state manufacture altogether from the purview of the convention, and the other, the views of those who wished to insist at least on a provision for publicity in regard to State manufacture. The United States Representative, though he had accepted membership of the Drafting Committee, had, in fact, declined to attend the meeting on the ground that it was impossible for him to co-operate in thim work until he was assured that a provision would be made for publicity in regard to State

The Meeting considered the Draft Provisional Agenda of the Forty-fifth session of the Council.
(Directors Meeting Paper No. 5).
Certain changes rere made and certain additional items put forward, which Mr. Buxton was asked to embody in a revised agenda.
ûi th reference to Item 8 - Eeport of the Special C ommittee on the Private Manufacture of Arips and Ammunition and Material of Usr - M. MADARIAGA said that the Council would probably forward the Eeport of the Special Committee to the Assembly, in order to explain to the Assembly why it had not been possible to carry out the wish which it had expressed at its last session for the early convocation of a Conference.
2
i-.ir. IICZIilirOL WOOD said that an item should be added to the agenda regarding the renort prepared by the legal Section on certain legal Questions
involved in	the application cf Ar	tide	16	of the
C ovenant.	It was desirable that	this	-v' n ->	ort should
be regarded	simply as a niece of	technical		advice
and should not be formal] -r adopted by the Council, as such approval might be embarrassing in the actual settlement of some future problem.
The 2ECR3?AHY-Gr51ThkML thought that, in those circumstances, the rapporteur should propose that the document should be circulated to the Members •f the League and the delegates to the assembly, as veil as to the League organs charged vith the study of article 16, for their information.
2.	The TCK J3 TAB Y JO El' TEAL said that he was not
without anxiety regarding the financial position of the league and had already asked the Treasurer to report on the subject. He would ask Directors to	t
think very carefully before proposing expenditure for objects which, though useful in themselves, were not of first-cllss importance to the league. This applied particularly to missions by members of the Secretariat, as it would be unfortunate if missions of real importance in the general interests of the League had to be foregone because of indiscriminate expenditure on ordinary missions.
3
M. DUS' CUB. -F SR Oil G 3 said that he himself had found that, for some of his official journeys, he could dispense with the assistance of a secretary. He felt that this was a useful economy to effect, when practicable.
The 33CRF TAKY-G3KSEAL agreed, on the understanding that each oase should he considered on its merits, as very often the presence of a secretary was indispensable.
M. SUGIMOBA said that he attached the greatest importance to voyages of members of the Secretariat in extra-European countries. Such voyages were all the more necessary, ov;ing to the inevitable difficulties of maintaining proper liaison between the league and those countries.
The S3CR3TABY-G3FERAL said that these visits were certainly very desirable, but in order that they might be made, it might be necessary to diminish the amount of
travelling in Jhirope.
M. EADAEIAGA suggested that, in some future budget estimates, it might be useful to insert a special chapter for travelling on missions outside Europe.
3.	The S3CE3TARY-G31TIRAL said that the Supervisory
Commission had not made very serious cuts in the draft budget for 1928, with the exception of the budget for the Fconoraic and Financial Section, where as reduction of seme 175,DOG francs had been made.
The TB3ASTJE3B said that the point at which criticism from the strictly budgetary point of view was most likely to be levelled was the freedom with which transfers in the various chapters of the budget ..»ere made.
-4-
4.	The marquis PALUCCI said that the Jury of Architects had not been able to agree to adopt finally any one of the plans submitted, as the best exceeded the estimates allowed. It had therefore decided to award prizes to the nine best plans and mentions to the second nine and third nine respectively. It would hold a public meeting on Thursday, at which the names of the winning competitors would be made public,
The SECRETARY-SENEGAL said that the trouble was that the architects had completely misled the Assembly with regard to the cost of the building. hat might happen now was that either the nine best plans would be submitted to the Assembly, which might then decide to vote the extra money for what it considered the best, or the first nine might be asked to adjust their plans so as to make them fall within the estimates, or as near to them as possible.
M. BONNET said that once the names were known, it would be very hard, for reasons of nationality, to agree on the best plan.
5.	Dr, RAJ OH MA said that the Office International and the Health Committee had recently held meetings, at which an agreement had been reached as regards epidemiological intelligence, and also on several ether points in connection with the International Ivnitary Convention,
A most successful conference on rabies had also
been held.
-5-
In reply to the SECRETARY-dElHFAI. he said that he thought that the arrangement now male between the Office and the Committee for mutual co-operation was successful, and preserved intact the freedom of the Council and the Assembly.

French Government would very like3.y give this year a son of 100,COO francs for certain equipment; that a meeting of experts would be held on 16th May to consider certain questions relating to facilities for
the translation of hooks into foreign languages; that the Italian and Hungarian Governments had nominated representatives to the Institute, and that
a oertain liaison between the U.&.S.R. and the Institute was not altogether improDable.
3
4,	Mr. COLBAN, having returned from Oslo, so id that the
Norwegian Socialist Party, which had formerly been fairly friendly to the League, had now allied itself wigh the Communist Party, and had accepted hostility to the League as- the price of the union. Though the allied parties might be the 1orgeat group after the general elections in the autumn, he felt fairly confident that the formation of a Socialist Government would not, in fact, have its logical consequence in the withdrawal of Norway from the League, since such a government being a minority government would immediately be defeated if they put forward any such proposal. He thought it might help matters if the Information Section could prepare an objective statement of the attitude c£ Socialist parties and of the utterances of Socialist leaders in various eountries regarding the Le agu o.
M. COMLBT eaid that this could be done.
5.	M. 3UGIMUIU. eaid that a comparatively large
number of Japanese journalists were following the Lconomic Conference, and the practice of distributing the tents cr summaries of speeches at the meeting had so facilitated their work that the Confer once was receiving better publicity in Japan than the sossions of the Assembly itself. He felt sure that this publicity, together with uho meeting of the Three-Power Naval Conference at Geneva, would impress Japan favourably.
As regards the oiroulation of the texts or summaries of speeches, he wondered whether the same method might not he adopted at the Assembly.
M. COI/EBT said that the Information Section had made the experiment at the Economic Conference of appointing a member to follow the work of each of the seven committees or sub-committees now sitting, and to prepare for journalists a resume of each speech as it was made. Journalists could not, of course, follow all these meetings themselves, and the new system, while very helpful to them, nevertheless placed them somewhat at the mercy of the Secretariat. However, they did not seem to mind. Ho thought that the same system might bo followed at Assembly committees.
The SECIILfAHY-GEE_3AI agreed that this preparation of resumes by the Information lection was useful, and ho would like to see it followed at the Assembly, He had understood, however, that II. Sugimura was referring principally to a somewhat different matter, namely, the rule of the Economic Conference that speakers, before the full conference, and before making their speech, should hand in to the Chair either a resume of what they proposed to say, or the full text the translation of which was then distributed. He doubted whet hap this practice couod be successfully followed at meetings the discussions at which wore as varied as were those of the Assembly. It might even impair such spontaneity as still existed in Assembly debates.
LI. 3UGIKUKA said that of he did not care much what was. the system adopted, provided that at my rate resumes
5
Ox s-caches wer- available fox' jouxnalisto, and ha gathered from M. Oomort that, at future sessions of the Assembly* this would be possible, both as regards plenary or committee meetings* Vhat he wished to emphasise was how hard it was for Japanese journalists - and he felt that the sane might be true, to some extent* of other journalists whose native tongue was not English or 1renoh - to report speeches satisfactorily morely from hearing them.
In any case he would like to suggest that there should never be a double translation of speeches delivered in a language other than Irenoh or English* It diould be possible to insist that the text of these speeches, at any rate* should be reoeived in time to allow of the distribution of one, at least, of the translations,
k. DUPOIR-rSROUCL said that this was not always easy. Sometimes a speaker, who was not a master of one ox the official languages, had to speak impromptu, e.g., in reply to a previous spoeoh.
The SEORuTAkY-GLlJ^RAl agreed that, as regards committee debates, the difficulty mentioned by 11. Dufour-1 eronce had to be accepted. As regards set speeches in the As embly, however, the procedure proposad by L. Sugimura might well be applied, when practicable, ae was, however, opposed to taking any official action such as might lead to changes in the nules of procedure, or to a discussion of the question of official languages. There was no perfect solution of this problem and the present system seemed to him the least unsatisfactory.

The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that an effort would be made to end the Economic Conference before the International Ji'aboux Conference, which opened on May 25th.
The progress of the Conference was considered to be satisfactory ana one possible result was that the United States of America would take a regular part in the work of such Organisation as might follow up the recommendations of the Conference, and might even associate itself more closely than hitherto with the other technical work of the League,
There was little likelihood of a new organisation being formed as a result of the Conference bvt a remodelling of the economic yommittee might be expected.	As regards the Russian
delegates, his impression was that, though they might not -have changed their mind regaroing the ¿league, they had learned to distrust its methods less through seeing them at close quarters.

M. C01IEST said that the publicity accorded to the Conference was excellent,
(2)	The SECHETARY-GBITEEAL said that he had received
an official letter ashing for facilities to be given by the Secretariat for the meeting of the Three Powers Bavai Conference. Certain questions, ^’hich, however, he f$lt did not present any great practical difficulty, would need to be considered, e.g., the supervision of such Secretariat staff as might be placed at the disposal of the Conference.
M. COMEET asked that any work that might be placed on the Information Section by the Conference shoula be clearly defined. He presumed that the Secretariat of the Conference itself would write its communiques.
)	The SECRETABY-GhliEHAl said that he had been
Officially informed that the London meeting of the Committee of Three on the Hungarian Optants would begin in London on May 30th. He had asked M. Suginura to attend the meeting on his behalf.
4)	The SECRETARY - GmliLEAl said that he would go to
London for a week on about the £lst. If Undox-Sccretaries-Genoial or Directors wished him to discuss any questions there, be was at their disposal.
5)
M. MADARIAGA emphasised the necessity of conversations, especially between the Great -towers, turning placu with a view to the Ijovember session of the preparatory
Committee for the Disarmament Conference.
'without such
preliminary conversations,, a severe
check might be expected.
3 -
The Secretary-General might think that this was a point to raise in London on his next or on some later visit»
(6)	1£, MADABIAGA wondered whether some members of
the Secretariat, perhaps some of the British and Japanese members, together with some members of the disarmament Section, might not follow the Three Power ITaval Conference with a view to examining the possibilities of linking up its work with the general work of disarmament. Ee did not wish to press this suggestion at all, but it seemed to him worthy of consideration»
M. SUGIIfURA thought that the Secretariat might be well advised to adopt a waiting attitude. The Three Powers would certainly try to achieve some concrete result at the Conference without necessarily considering the relation of such result to the general work of disarmament. This was a fact which had to he faced, and it might be best to avoid any risk of giving the impression that the Secretariat was making an organised effort to relate the vTork of the Conference to the general work for disarmament. On the other hand, something might he done to the same end by discreet and informal means.
The SECRETABY-G^iiERAl agreed with M. Sugimura.
Ee expected that many meetings of the Conference would be public and obviously these should be closely fo 1 lowed by the Disarmament Section.	He was, however, disinclined to
organise on the lines tentatively suggested by M. Radariaga the Secretariat’s study of the work of the Conference,
There would doubtless be contacts between members of the Secretariat and Delegates to the Conference, iaorcovor,
4
he felt that the po a it ion of the British Empire as "being partly a European Bower wou?,d make it hard for the Conference to agree on measures which disregarded the question of disarmament in general and the attitude which might be adopted by Ilaval Powers other than the Three»
(?)	Ma SCGrUtTUPA said that the meeting of the
Economic Conference was producing an excellent impression in Japan, especially owing to the presence of Delegates from the U.S.A, and the UcS„S„R. Japanese opinion was realising that some of the work of the League at any rate was fully universal in character. He would like measures to be taken to ensure that this interest now aroused should not wane. Eor instance, the Secretariat might publish as soon as possible a pamphlet on the results of the Conference.
M, DUEOUR i’EROxiCE said that he thought it was already the intention to do this.

imrUTES OF THE DIRECTORS’ MEETING held on Wednesday, May 25th, at 4.30 p.m.
PRESENT: The Acting Secretary-General (Marquis Paulucci)
Dame Rachel Crowdy MM. Sugimura Salter Colhan Jacklin Catastini IvlcIZinnon Wood Norman White Stoppani Brivonesi Walters Sweetser Hiam Bonnet
von Schmieden Wilson - Secretary.
(1)	The ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he had attended that morning, on behalf of the Secretary-General, the opening of the International Labour Conference. Sir Atul Chatterjee, Delegate of India, had been elected President.
(2)	The ACTIIIG. SECRETARY-GENERAL read a list of five supplementary items which were to be added to the Provisional Agenda of the Forty-fifth Session of the Council (Annex).
The DIRECTORS concerned explained the bearing of each of these five items.
It was noted that no Rapporteur had been put down for Item 4, but that M.Sugimura would discuss this question with the Secretary-General in London.
-2
(3)	Sir ARTHUR SALT:III said that, while the Report
of tlie Hconomic Conference would be submitted to the Council at its June session, it would not be until the following session that the Council would be called upon to consider how the Conference might affect the work of the Secretariat.
The Conference had been on the whole, he thought, a success. Its work on commerce was its most important result. This had in fact been expected and the opinion which vas sometimes heard that the Conference had begun by being principally industrial and ended by being principally commercial was mistaken.
It was possible that the Conference would be a turning point in international commercial policy.
Finally, he wished to pay tribute to the excellent worn done by the Central Services, on whom the Conference had placed a remarkably heavy strain. Some of the lessons of tlie Conference might perhaps be borne in mind at the Assembly, especially the advantages, to which II.
Sugimura had referred at a previous uirectors1 fleeting, of havingtranslations of set speeches prepared beforehand, II.
II. SI0PP.UII added that another result would be that agriculture would have to be specially represented in international economic organisations.
The AC TIBS SRCRHTnRY- GRIIRRAL agreed that the
-3-
results of the Economic Conference were on the whole very satisfactory. It had occurred to him, however,
vihen following the debates of the Conference, that efforts to obtain unanimity had occasionally been pushed too far. Naturally it was +o the good if a unanimous resolution represented a substantial measure of general agreement, but was it not sometimes the case that such resolutions were merely clever formulae devised to gloss over essential differences of opinion, and that, in consequence, they would have little practical effect because they would be differently interpreted according to the different ideas Delegates had had in accepting them? In such a case, he questioned whether a majority resolution, corresponding, as it would, more nearly to the true situation, would not be preferable. Naturally, he would only suggest that course in the case of nonpolitical questions.
Sir ARTHUR SAUTER felt that unanimity was valuable if too great a price was not paid for it. Supposing, for instance, that the Economic Conference had adopted three or four sets of resolutions on each subject, the result would have been intolerably confusing. Moreover, the desire to reach unanimity did enable Delegates to compromise and thus enable some collective opinion, which after all was what was desired, to emerge. Otherwise Conferences would simply crystal!se the existing difference of opinion between States, thus leaving matters rather worse than befor«? whereas the via media which was now found did represent
the greatest measure of general progress possible.
4
The ACTING SECRE T A BY-GENERAL considered that, eve® when full weight had been given to Sir Arthur Salter's arguments, there ^ere nevertheless cases in which it would have been in the general interest for the Conference to divide and °or each side frankly to state its view. Hor instance, it -as somewhat absurd that the Soviet Delegation at the Economic Conference had voted against all the partial
I
resolutions hut had merely abstained in the vote on the final resolution.
Sir ARTHUR SA1TDR thought that the vote of the Soviet Delegation vras rather a special case.
With regard to the general question raised by the Acting Seeretary-General, he was satisfied that the resolutions of the Economic Conference did represent a genuine measure of agreement and that opposing resolutions b~- big groups, e.g. free traders and protectionists, would not really have been more substantial. To see the disadvantages of the opposite method, it was necessary to refer only to the resolutions of the Genoa Conference which were so burdened with qualifications as to be almost meaningless. However, he agreed with the Acting Secretary-General that there might be cases where unanimity could bo bought too dearly and that it was not necessary to follow obstinately only the one system:.
Mr. SWEETSEE said that a communication had come from tho U.S.A. legation at Herne stating that the Three-Power Naval Conference was finally fixed for the 20th June.
5
M. STOPPART said that invitations to the Diplomatic Conference on Export Prohibitions had been sent a month or tho ago and none had been sent to the U.S.S.R. as the settlement ■with Switzerland had not then been reached. Should an invitation now be sent?
11» 3UGIKURA thought that there was no doubt that one should be sent.
The question having been raised whether enquiries should not be made privately in order to find out whether the U.S.S.R. would accept the invitation, Mr. WALTERS said that such private enquiries had been found in practice to be unsatisfactory as it was easier for a Government privately to indicate that it did not '"ant to receive an invitation than having received ore publicly to refuse it*
The ACT IRQ SECRETARY-GERERA! thought that it was a little embarrassing to send the invitation to Russia without any immediate cause, but agreed that in the circumstances it would be best for it to be done.

The Meeting considered the revised provisional Agenda for the P ortv-I'ii th Session of the Council (Directors’ Ilesting Paper 6) .
Various small changes mere made which Mr. Buxton was asked to note .
The following points also arose in the course of
the discussion:
~ 2 -
(a! Item 12 (Convention concerning I.Iemel) .
The SMC" 3TAEY-GiSl]ErJVIi said that the Lithuanian (government held that this question should not appear on the Agenda and had indicated that accordingly it might send no representative to the Session, naturally, it was for the Council itself when it fin 11 y adopted the Agenda to decide whether the Lithuanian Government's contention was sound.
Usually the adoption of the Agenda took place at a -private meeting, hut it was perhaps of some importance that the Council’s consideration of this item, including its discussion of the preliminary question whether it should he retained on the Agenda of the cession, should take place in public. Possibly the Council would "then adopting the Agenda reserve its decision on the Heine 1 item, and, if the Lithuanian representative were present, declare that it would consider in public, say at its next meeting, the question whether the item should remain on the Agenda. On the other hand, if no Lithuanian representative were there, the Council liMnt decide at its first meeting equally to adjourn discussion of the point whether the item should be on the Agenda but it might declare that the matter would be discussed later in the (ieeeion in order to give the Lithuanian Goverhment an opportunity of being represented.
(b) I tern 11 (Llixed Hungaro-Roumanian Tribunal).
The 33CduLT.3Y-GA]iARAL said that there was a possibility that the Houma Plan Government might ask for the postponement of this question.
The Meeting considered the question of the programme for the opening of the Assembly (Directors1 Meeting Paper 3) .

- 3 -
The SAC A3TARYA13]S3RAL thought that the new procedure proposed would meet with no opposition from relegates, especially if, as was suggested, the proposals to he made by the President regarding the adoption of the agenda and the distribution of items among the Committee were circulated before the meeting at which they wore formally announced by the Chair,
The only question remaining was whether the tig speech by the Acting President of the Council should be delivered at the opening of the Session or at the beginning of the debate on the work of the Council. Administratively, the second alternative seemed to him preferable, but he attached great importance to the arguments used by M, Sugimura at previous meetings in favour of the former alternative, and rather against his will he had concluded that the speech should be made as at present at the opening of the Session.
M. MADAEIACA felt that the conception which underlay the first alternative was that the opening of the assembly was a world event, while the conception which underlay the second alternative was that the opening of the assembly should •:n the whole resemble the pening of a Parliament. W :u Id it not be possible to meet both these views by arranging that the Assembly might open as at present with a speech delivered
urbi et orbi and generally reviewing the work ox the League for the year while the debate n the work of the Council should be opened by a speech intended for the Assembly itself in which a '■'ember of the Council should as it were present the report n the work of the Council formally to the Assembly.
Mr. COLBA1J said that the work of the Council was just one Assembly document amongst others and there seemed no particu-
for special presentation.
lar reason why it should be selected
M. oUG-lMTJRÁ thought that II
o Madariaga r 5 proposal, though attractive, should not he accepted. It would tend to differentiate unduly between the Council and the Assembly, presenting the former in the guise of a Government which was called upon to render account to a Parliament. The respective functions cf the Assembly and Council were ill-defined noth in word and deed, and he deprecated measures which might tend to dispel this convenient obscurity.
IT. STOP Pill I thought that though the delivery cf a speech by the Acting President of the Council at the opening of the session might be accepted as a regular practice, the method of opening the debate on the work of the Council should not be too strictly defined.
The SjSCHTTARY-GAII.'JRAL agreed with fh Sugimura that nothing should be done which should give the impression that the Council was in the position cf a Government rendering account to a Parliament, but he wondered whether the debate on the work of the Council might not be usefully begun by an important speech prepared if need be by the Secretariat and delivered by a former President of the Assembly. However, there was no need for the meeting to come to a formal decision on this point.
It having emerged in the course of the discussion
that M, Bonnet would be asked to draft the speech for the Acting President of the Council, K. oUGIIfJRA took the opportunity of suggesting that in the next speech a little less emphasis might be laid on European problems.
- 5 «
«5.	TlL-< 3LC ALTARY-GnilLR AL saic that, on his recent
■visit to London, he hac encountered some pessimism regarding the League, duo principally to the cumulative effect of the treatment otherwise than through the League of three important international questions: the Anglo-Russian, the Chinese and the Italo-Yugo-Slav.
The work of the Lconomic Conference had given great satisfaction to those who had followed it, hut the Arcos raid and the Lindbergh flight had spared it little publicity.
In official circles, he found no diminution in interest in the League and in the desire to strengthen it.
It was true that the British Government sometimes used a private ana peculiar touch in forwarding these objects, but that it desired the good of the League he had no doubt.
Lastly, he felt it was vain to attempt to explain the Anglo-Russian break by reasons of general international policy. It had been caused by purely internal events.
M. lUPOUB-FLROIICl said that on Sunday ho had, in the absence of the Secretary-General, been rung up by a member of the Secretariat, who had happened tc come to the # office and find the Albanian telegram. He had succeeded in getting into touch with one or two of his colleagues, and they had togctler met at the Secretariat ana had prepared the necessary action. After some time they had been able to speak on the telephone to the Secretary-General, who was away iron Geneva.	./hat he desired to bring, to
the notice of the meeting was the fact thao it wus apparently by mere chance that an important telegram ha.d come into the hands of responsible officials, and secondly,
6
that it had Geers impossible to conduct the telephonic conversations otherwise than at the Conciergets box downstairs, in full view and hearing of passing visitors,
Mr. EUSTOIi said that as regards the first point, the system was that on all Sundays and holidays a Registry clerk should come to the Secretariat once in the morning and once in the afternoon, in order to see that any important communications should be conveyed to those competent to deal with them. He presumed, therefore, that the telegram to which If. Dufour-Ieronce referred, would have been opened and brought to his notice in any case. He would, however, enquire whether in feet this would have been so on Sunday. As regards the second point, there was clearly something wrong, as there were certain appointed offices in the Secretariat from and to which it should be possible to telephone on Sundays and holidays.
He would make the necessary enquiries.
Mr. GILCHRIST asked whether something should net be done to ensure that important telegrams which might arrive in the course of the night should receive immediate attention.
The SECRLTARY-GRHRRAL said that the question was one which had more than once been discussed. He did not wish to examine it further until Mr. Huston had enquired from the Internal Administration point of view into the facts which 11. Lufcur leronce had brought to the notice of the meeting.	He felt that if the existing system was properly
observed, there was little danger of serious delay in dealing with important communications, especially as (and he thought this also met Mr. Gilchrist's point) in times of crises, special measures were taken to see that messages were immediately brought to his notice.
7
M. DU.fOUR PLHOSTCjci saf d that he had recently complied with an invitation to speak on the work of the League at Leipzig to a meeting of the Association of Saxon Industrialists» The chief authorities of the city had also Deen present..	The interest had been greater and
the criticism less violent than he had expected from an , audience which he had been told was inclined to be hostile to the League,	It was true that his hearers retained
some scepticism but they appe ared impressed b2T what he had been able to tell them, and ready to admit that it was right to co-operate with an institution which afforded the least unhopeful prospect of ensuring international peace,
if. SUGrIMURA said that recent news from Japan strongly confirmed the statement which he had made at the previous meeting that the Economic Conference had made a very great impression indeed in his country. When the League carried out such a work of universal importance, there was certainly no lack of publicity for it,
Ur. GILCHRIST said that he had sent to the Secretary-General a report on his recent visit to the United States of .America,
The SECRETARY-GEIIERAL said that the report would be circulated to all Sections.
In reply to M. Uadariaga, the SECRETARY-GERLEAL said that he thought that the Anglo-Russian break would not affect the question whether the Soviet Government would be represented at the next session of the preparatory Committee for the disarmament Conference.
8
9.	te. MADARIAGA asked the Treasurer why the cost
of missions by members of the Information Section to attend League meetings away from Geneva should be charged to the Sections concerned, rather than the Information Section.
Mr. JACELIE said that the League rs budget was drawn up on the principle of budgeting for objects.
It was difficult to charge expenses partly to the object, and partly to the Section primarily concerned.
Mr. SWEETSMR said that members of the Information Section often attended meetings rather for the advantage of the Section concerned than for publicity reasons.
There was some dissent from this view.
The SBCHETAEY-GEEERAl, while admitting the correctness of the Treasurer’s statement of principle thought that in deciding actual cases, account should be taken not only of the principle but of general financial necess itles.
10.	Mr. JACKLIIJ appealed to Sections to surrender
25,000 francs needed for the Tress Experts Conference.
Eis impression was that the Administrative Commissions, Transit and Mandates Sections were the most likely’' to volunteer.
The SECBETAEY-CEEEBAL hoped that they would, as the alternative might be to ask for another transfer from the Lisarmement Conference, which he was most loth to do.

(l)	The SECRET SR Y-GENERAL said that the Forty-fifth
Session of the Council had been severely criticised in the press of .nag land, France and Germany, (the Italian comments being less unfavourable), on the ground that all difficult questions had been adjourned.
2 -
Of the thirty-three questions on the Agenda, the vast majority of the reports has been adopted by the Council as originally put forward. None of these asked for adjournment, though in one or two important questions, for instance, the question of Article 16 ana 11 of the Covenant, the Council had proposed that the main discussion should take place at the Assembly»
Of the few remaining questions, that concerning Meme1 did not call for decision by the Council owing to the apparent success of the preliminary direct negotiations.
That of the Hungarian Optants had had to be adjourned, but the Council's Gommittee had worked extremely hard on this question and had put forward definite suggestions to the two Governments. Certainly the adjournment was not, as critics seemed to suppose, due to indifference or idleness on the part of the Council.
Another, that of The Westerplatte had been adjourned for a good reason, namely, that the Rapporteur had received many voluminous documents on the subject only some four days before the Session and he could not take the responsibility of recommending without further study a definite solution to his colleagues. However, the professions of the two Parties that they both desired an immediate settlement had undoubtedly made the adjournment of this question unpopular.
To explain the general dissatisfaction he felt, therefore, that a reason must be sought other than the Council's handling of the actual questions on its Agenda.	His own
impression was that the meeting simultaneously with the council of six Powers calling themselves a Conference and discussing a Question of such general importance as the Russian situation
"but without the participation of even such interested States as Poland, Romania and Czecho~Slovakia, had provoked resentment amongst the excluded Powers.	The press had teen infected
with this resentment (for it too had been kept out of the Conference) and it had hastened to condemn the who le Session.
Having said this much, he wished to avoid giving the impression, and he hoped that journalists would also avoid giving the impression, that there was something detrimental to the League in the holding of private conversations between members of the Council in the course of the Sessions.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER agreed that no objection could be taken to casual meetings of two ox three Members of the Council, but to his mind it was both wnrong and unjustifiable that formal meetings of Powers selected without reference to their interest in the particular problem to be discussed should be held.
There was another kind of meeting which was undesirable, but perhaps in certain circumstances justifiable, namely, a formal meeting of Powers, including all those interested to discuss a given question.
Mr. COLBAN agreed with Sir Arthur Salter but objected even to his third class of meetings. -Any meeting outside the Council which had a kind of ’’Protocol" was undesirable and yet it appeared that at the Beau-Rivage there was a special Council Room where meetings were held for which convocations were sent and where it might even be said that everything was done in competition with the meetings of the Council. He supported the idea that the League should not he jealous ar.d that it should desire questions to be solved in whatever way was best, but the institution of these formal meetings seemed to him to constitute a real danger to the League.
— 4 -
In reply to the Secretary-General, Hr. Colban said that he saw no objection to the work which had formerly been done by the Conference Ambassadors being liquidated at Geneva by meetings between the interested Powers.
M. DUPOUB-i'E'ROUCE drew attention to an article in the Kfflnische Zeitung of 17th June which had given, so it seemed to him, an interesting explanation of the dissatisfaction with which the Session had been regarded.	The article,
which M. Dufour-Per once read to the meeting, reviewed the criticisms which had been made in various quarters, and concluded that the true explanation was that the League had reached a certain stage in its development in which the contradiction between its traditional and somewhat narrow field of action and the wide range of important ‘problems whioh, though not on the CouneilTs Agenda really preoccupied the minds of its members, had become acutely manifest. The • question was whether it would be possible to harmonise these two forms of activity at Geneva and to fit into the frame-work of the League the big world problems which really concerned, it and which were calling ever more urgently for solution,
If the Council clung timidly to the established system and allowed European unrest to pursue its course unorganised outside the sphere of the League, some day "real" politics would 'gweep the League away. If, on the other hand, the leaders of League po Licy had the energy and courage gradually to allow the really political problems to be drawn within t^he League’s orbit, there was reason to hope that the new perioel of League history which had begun with Germany’s entry, would eventually result in permanent solidarity between the patio ns o
5
The Marquis PAULUCCI DI CAIROLI thought that it was vain to attempt to impose rules on the Members of the Council as to how they should meet in private. Such limitation was not only impractical)le but in fact undesirable, as it was in the interest of the League that these private conversations should be held 'because in them questions might be matured and their ultimate insertion on the Agenda of Council Sessions facilitated. Besides, it was important that foreign ministers and other influential statesmen should come to Geneva, and in cases where the formal Agenda of the Council was lacking in interest, these private conversations offered an attraction.
It should be remembered moreover that no member of the Council had been excluded from the discussion of the items which had really been on the Agenda of the Session, and that these conversations had not led to any formal conclusions.-He agreed, however, that it was perhaps unwise to make it appear that a formal Conference differently composed from the Counoil was being held, and that a communique of its proceedings had been issued.
The S B GRRlT ARY- Gil ITERAI said that nevertheless they -were faced with the practical difficulty that if so important a question as the Russian question was discussed by a grouo of Powers at Geneva and the Poreign Minister of Poland (to take an example) was not invited, he would be annoyed with the le ague as a who le .
The Marquis PAULUCCI DI CALBOLI said that all he wished to make clear was that it was impossible to infringe the freedom of the Members of the Council to discuss questions privately at Geneva with whom they wished.
After all,
6 -
similar conversations were held daily between the Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors in any of the important capitals and between the- capitals themselves,
M. MADARIAGA, while agreeing with the Secretary-General and Sir Arthur Salter, wished to draw attention to the important point raised by the Marquis Paulucci that, so far as was known, private conversations had not led. to definite decisions» It would indeed be serious if the Council were placed in a position where it was virtually compelled to ratify decisions made at such meetings and perhaps there was a risk of this if the habit of private meetings grew.
M. COMLRT thought that the instinct of the press
had been sound - it had denounced things which friends of
the League mostly thought were wrong. He disagreed with
the Marquis Paulucci as regards the issue of the communique.
The one redeeming feature of the six-Power Conference was
*»
in his opinion that the communique had been issued.
The effect of these private meetings, o„g. at Moscow, had been deplorable enough, but it would have been worse if no kind of account of the discussions had been given. It was safe to announce to the press that a meeting nad oeen held, of the Powers represented by the Conference Ambassadors and Germany without giving the result of the conversationss but a bare announcement of the fact that a group of Powers had met to discuss such an important question as the Russian question could not fail to meet with criticism.
~ 7 -
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the journalists for all their sagacity had erred in including in their condemnation the Council's handling of the questions actually on its Agenda.
The Marquis PAUXUCCI El CAIRO LI thought that it might he useful to let journalists understand that no guarantee could he given that the Councilrs agenda would always he exciting.
Mr. McKIiUJOH '#0OE suggested that, in future the Council in its Resolutions should not say that it "adjourned the question to a future Session", hut that it "plaoed the question on the Agenda df the next Session or the next Session
hut .........n: for while the former method gave an impression
of dilate tines s, the latter gave an impression of activity.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed, and asked that this should he noted by Eirectors in preparing reports in the future,
M. CATA3TIITI said that the question seemed to he one of form rather than substance, namely, the way the Ministers met rather than what they said at their meetings; hut would the wishes of the Secretariat as regards their way of doing things influence the people concerned?
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was all a question of propriety and tact, hut he could conceive circumstances in which members of the Secretariat could give to responsible Ministers whom they knew well their Impression that certain kinds of procedure had been somewhat damaging to the League.. So member of the Secretariat had a mission to give or impose these opinions, while if he did it was for the responsible person to heed his words or not as he thought right.
,i, DUPOUR IE.R01JCB felt that there was room for anxiety in the adjournment of the nungarian Optamts question, as it was felt that the general principle of arbitration which nattered so much to the League night be endangered thereby.
The Marquis PAULUCCI LI CALBOLI ashed whether the meeting had any comment to make on a proposal made by Mr. Buxton that the replies of Governments to questionnaires should not be circulated singly as they came but accumulated until a certain number could be circulated.
It was agreed, without making a formal rule cn the subject, that this should in future generally be the practice.
Sir Arthur SALTER asked whether special precautions should not be taken to ensure that the new building which might be approved by the Assembly should be suitable from the practical point of view. Would it not be wise to revive the Building Committee?
The Marquis PAULUCCI LI CALBOLI said that the plans had themselves been drawn up in accordance with specifications of practical needs.	Sir Arthur Salter could feel assured
that, whatever method might be adopted, these needs would be looked after.
Mr. GO LB A J thought it important that some really responsible person should see to financial control in the matter of contracts and other expenses connected with the building. He did not want the responsibility to lie with a Committee virtually depending on its secretary.
9
The SUGRETAEY-GiiSilRAL said that the control would certainly he exercised, though the best method had not yet been determined«
:;r. JACKLIU said that in any case he as Treasurer would beep a close eye on all expenses.

(l)	The SBCiLaTAiiY-GijiitaHAl saia that the Supervisory
Commission which was to meet at che ena ox the week in ■’Paris woulu uiscuss two important questions:
(1)	The adjustment of salaries.
(2)	The promotion oi "£" members of Section to ,TA” members.
2
With reference to the second question* the Secretary-General said that the Secretariat view had always "been that nBn and "A" membership lormed one grade.
A HBn hlember who had not done satisfactory work would not be promoted to WA,T membership, but if he had done good work it was the custom to budget for an "A" post when his promotion was due and promote him accordingly*
Some ¡¿embers of the Supervisory Commission were inclined to object to this system on the ground that:
l) In time nearly all the members of the Sections in the Secretariat would be ,TA,r Members and thus there would not be a proper proportion between the numbers of nA” and "3" members, ana 2} Provision for such promotion was not made in the International Labour Office*
An analysis of the facts prepared by the Treasurer nov/ed that the former ground of objection was not sound, he proportion of nBTT to "ATr members was now greater than in 923 and there was no reason to believe that it would be ■reatly altered, as, when "A” members left the Secretariat,
'B* members came in.
As regards 2) it was for various reasons not possible to compare the Secretariat with the International Labour Office in this respect.
Accordingly the Secretary-General intended to resist any change in tha present system ana, if he did not convince the Supervisory Commission, to bring the matter before the Assembly.
I
*- o —
( 2)	XV-. CATA8TIPI said that the Permanent Mandates
Commission had discussed with some vigour the question whether the terra "possesses sovereignty subject to the terms of the mandate” used by the Government of South Africa in a recent Treaty with Portugal correctly defined the position or a mandatory Power. Some members of the Commission had argued that: the expression was unobjectionable as the word "possesses” could in lav bear the interpretation "exercises" or "enjoys the use of" as opposed to "has in full ownership", but the Commission as a whole objected to the expression an6 would say so to the Council. However, by affirming that sovereignty did not

K. PUPOUB-lnHOACL thought th-t it was unfortunate that the South African Government had used the word "sovereignty", for it was a word which could not describe the rights oi a mandatory Power.
The SLChATAHY-GxilJLnAL feared that the w
might feel conp
o unc i 1
elieu to inform the Commission that, as it was not a body of jurists and as the question which it raised was a legal one, it did not desire to have its

The SLCPMTAEY-CLiTnBAL expressed surprise that the Commission should hold this view.
Whatever opinion might be held as to sovereignty, the powers of the Commission were clearly defined under the Covenant and remained intact, for obviously the rights of the mandatory, whether rightly defined by the "'ord sovereignty or not, were limited by the provisions of the mandate and the Covenant.

The SSCPETASY-GENERAL said that the Supervisory Commission at its recent meeting in Paris had, after hearing the Secretary-General*s explanations, agreed not to seek to change the present system of the Secretariat as regards the promotion of ,TB" Members of Section to "A" Members. As regards one of the arguments used "by the Secretary-General, namely, the intention of the assembly in this resoect, the Commission had reserved its opinion.
With regard to the adjustment of salaries, the Commission had postponed any recommendation for stabilisation. It had, however, recognised the desirability ox changing the present system by causing the variable portion of the salary to vary exactly with changes in the cost of living. If it had not been for the opposition of the International Labour Office, he thought that he might have succeeded in securing stabilisation of salaries at the 1921 rates.
The SECRETARY-GSICRAL said that a League Conference had recently been summoned to which nationals of two-thirds to three quarters of the States Hembers of the League had been invited, hut no nationals of the remaining Hembers. There
*
had been reasons for the adoption of this system in the particular case, but he had come to the conclusion that it was a method which should, if possible, not be used for future Conferences. .hen it had been found possible to invite nationals of a big majority of Hembers, it was difficult tc explain to the Government of a country of which no national had been invited, should it protest, why that country had been e rcludec..
The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked Under-Secretaries-General and Directors to think over the question of the best method for the selection of the final plan for the building.
The question could be discussed when they met again.
The SSCIGT/SlY-GsUIRAL said that the Ciraolo Conference seemed to he proceeding fairly well.' The difficulty was the jealousy which existed, between the Internatiohal Red
3
Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies. If the formation of an International Relief Union helped to reconcile these differences, it would be doing a good service.
Hr. McEIHFOF HOOD said that the Draft Statutes of the Union presented considerable legal difficulties.
The SUCRETARY-GEUER^L hoped that these would be
overcome .
H. CATA3TIHI read out the Resolution adopted by the Permanent Mandates Commission as regards the appointment of a German Member.
The SECRETARY GE FERAL said that he was not surprised at the terms of the Resolution as, in his opinion, the Council had put the Commission in a difficult position by its request.
H. CAIASIIEI said that he nevertheless feared the effect of the discussions on public opinion. The Minutes of the Committee, which would be published, showed that the proposal had been opoosed by nationals of mandatory Powers.
t
The reputation of the Commission for impartiality might therefore suffer.
H. AT3ROL thought that M. Catastini was unduly pessimistic. After all, the act of the Commission was its Resolution and not the individual opinions expressed in the course of discussion. Incidentally, he felt that the present case showed the disadvantage of the publication of the Minutes of the Commission in full.
M. CATASTIUI said that the Commission set much store by the publication of its Minutes.

MINUTES OF THE DIRECTORS1 MEETING,
Held on Wednesday, the 13th July, 1927. at 3.30 p.m.
Pre sen t:
The Acting Secretary-General (II. Avenol) Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone MM. Duf ou r-Her one e Sugimura Salter
de Madariaga Haas Jacklin Catastini McKinnon Wood Walters Homan White Hosting Bruce oleri
Wilson (Secretary).
The ACTING SECRETARY-GEUERAl said that copies of letters asking for information or enclosing invitations to attend meetings were sometimes received simultaneously hy various Sections of the Secretariat. As recent cases, he quoted firstly the invitations sent to various Directors to attend the Conference on World Population, and, secondly, a request from a man in Paris to receive information concerning the relation of various organs of the League with the U.S«S.R.f which had
“been sent direct to various sections.
It was possible that conflicting replies might be sent to such communications, and he wondered whether it might not be vjise, when Directors received invitations which looked as if they might also be sent to other Directors, to consult the Secretary-General’s Office before replying.
Sir Arthur SALTER ¿id not think it would be necessary to lay down any rule. In some cases, e.g., in the case of the
request for information concerning out relations with the U.S.SoR., common-sense w ou Id. clireèt that Directors should mate enquiries before replying; but to several invitations - for instance, invitations exclusively concerning the work: of their own Section -Directors should, reply v:i thou t consulting anyone.
fhs Marquis PAULTJCCI DI CAnSOIdL thought that the guiding principle should be whether the general responsibility of the League was likely to be engaged in any way by the reply which a Director might make.
Dr. lICxu-ÎAl'î Y/HIT3 said that he was glad that the question had been raised. Owing to the special interest to the Health Organisation of the problems to be dealt with by the -<orld Population Conference, he had agreed to go himself unofficially as an observer. He had supposed that the request for information with regard to the relations with the U.S.G-R., which would seem to have been written by someone who knew the League’s work well, had been sent to the Health Organisation only, because these relations had been wider in the case of the Health Organisation than in the case of any other League organ. He had, in fact, replied refusing to give any information.
M. Dg MADARIAGA said that the letter regarding the ïï.S.3.R., had, in his case, been addressed to the P^A.C^, and not to the Secretariat, and he had consulted the Secretary-General’s Office before rep luring.
LM HAAS thought that great prudence was necessary on the part of Directors in considering invitations to attend Coniereno even as observers. If they were invited merely as individuals, the case was different, but if they represented in any way, however
slight, the League of Nations, the Press noted this fact, and no account was taken of the qualifications with which acceptance might
have been hedged. All that was known was that the League had been represented, and sometimes this might lead to difficulties.
Mc LRUGCOLERI agreed; and quoted a ease in which league representation by an observer at a Conference with certain propaganda aims had been exploited as indicating the League1 s identification with these aims»
Dr. EORMAD WHITE hoped that representation at the World Population Conference would not be considered dangerous. This worn was of great interest tc the League, and it was useful for members of the Secretariat to follow it.
The Acting Secretary-General, summing up, said that (l) the invitation to the World Population Conference was one which some kind of preliminary consultation between the Directors concerned might usefully have been made before replying;
(b) as regards the future, there was no need to lay down a rule; but he asked Directors to use prudenoe in replying to invitations or requests for information which might effect other Sections. When in doubt, they could consult the Secretary Generales Office, or, as the Information Section was in a position to give information concerning the activity of the organisations from which invitations proceeded, the Information Section.
M.-. HAAS said that the Ciraolo Conference had ended w.ith satisfactory results. At the beginning there had been much scepticism, hut this appeared to have given way to a oonviotion that the International Relief Union would perforai useful functions. It would probably come into existence within a year or two. A notable feature had been the support of the American Red Cross.
-4-
■3. M, Haas asked if the Secretariat had any means of influencing the Association des Intérêts de Geneve? He did not like to see meetings of the Advisory Committee on Communications and Transit apnearing in a list of "festivités" of the Genevese season; nest, e.g., to the International Canine Congress »
The Marquis Paulucci di Oalboli said that he would speak to M. I'unier on the matter»
4. M » I>u four - ? è ronce said that the month was a busy one for the Intellectual Co-operation Committee and its various organs» Meetings of the Ik pert Committee on the Instruction of the Young and of toe University Co-ordination Committee had been held and the meeting of the Bibliographical Committee had just ended, with satisfactory results. The plenary committee would meet in the foilow/ing wook,
5c Mr, McKinnon Wood drew attention to the long time which it took for documents to be printed» The proceedings of the last session of the Assembly, for instance, had just apooarq-\ was there an insufficiency of staff somewhere, û.g. in the Proof loading Section, wnich explained this?
M.> de Madariaga thought that, in general, too Secretariate arrangements with regard to publications were not altogether satisfactory. In many Sections there were officials with experience in the preparation of published documents regarding-their Section fe.g», in his own, Capitaine Ma the net ), and he would suggest that a committee of 3 or 4 such officials, with one or two members of the technical publications of proof reading staff, might examine the whole question thoroughly.
-5-
The Acting Seoro tary-Goneral thought that it would be better that Sections should send to the Publications Committee any observations which they might have to make, stating clearly their criticisms and backing them up by concrete examples,
Mr McKinnon Wood also thought that it was difficult for Sections to answer tho question which was put to them in authorising publications, viz», how many copies should be printed*
The.Acting Secretary-General said that the difficulty wa3
to know how many should be printed for free distribution, and tho Sections were most competent to say this.
Mru Jacklin observed that Sections were also responsible for providing the money for the publications which concerned them, and it was for thorn to say how many copies should he printed.

Wilson (Secretary).
The meeting considered the Draft Provisional Agenda for the 46th session of the Council, and the Draft Supplementary list of items for the Agenda of the 8th session of the Assembly (Directors’ Meeting paper 7).
Various small changes were made to be embodied in the revised text of the Agenda.
The following points also arose in the course of the discussion:-? '
(a)	I tern 10: Report on the fu ture constitution of the Economic Organisation of the League: The iLRCUIS PAITLUCCI II C..L30U wondered whether an item thus worded might not give the impression that it was intended to create a new Economic Organisation.
Perhaps Item 10 should be combined, therefore, with Item 3.
M. RUEFF said that the insertion of Item 10 was
necessitated by a decision of the Council and concerned the
- 2 -
remodelling of the existing organisation, and not the creation of a new organisation. I tern 10, however, might follow Item 3 on the Uganda.
fh) Item 0: Interpretation of Articles 190 and 192 of the Treaty of Versailles - Croiseur Salamis: Request submitted by the Greek Government:	Mr. MGEIlTITOîî WOOD gave information
regarding this item. He thought that the Council would probably appoint a Committee of Jurists to examine its competence in the matter.
It was suggested that the Colombian Representative might be the Rapporteur.
(c)	Item 12:	Request of the Roumanian Government under
paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Covenant regarding its communication addressed to the Mixed Roumano-Eungarian Arbitral Tribunal on the 24th February, 1927.
Request of the Hungarian Government for the appointment by the Council, in virtue of Article 239 of the Treaty of Trianon of tv;o deputy arbitrators for the Mixed Roumano-Hungarian Arbitral Tribunal:	Ytfith reference to this item, M. DUFOUR-FEEONCE
asked whether it was proposed that anything should be done by the league to strengthen the authority of Mixed Arbitral Tribunals, the maintenance of which deeply concerned the League, and was threatened by the action of the Roumanian Government.
M. SUGIIRJRA said that, while it was realised that the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals were supreme within the sphere of their competence, the question in this case was whether one of them had exceeded its competence.
3
Mr. MCKINNON WOOD said that, important though it was to the League that tribunals should function properly, they did not work under the guarantee of the League. He doubted, therefore, whether the League could do anything to strengthen them.
The ACTING- SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the ansv?er to M. Dufour-J?eronce1 s question seemed to be that the Council was not invited to pronounce on any wider question than the two points raised in Item 12 of the Agenda. It might, of course, happen that in the course of the Council's discussion the general question would be raised.
(d)	Item 17: Danzig; Protection of aircraft within the Free City: Report of the Air iiSub-C ommjttee of the Permanent Advisory Commission; M. HAAS asked Whether it was wise that this question should be treated as being purely military. It seemed to him that it presented certain aspects of interest to commercial aerial navigation , and in that case the Transit Commission might be consulted.
M. de MADARIAGA while agreeing with M. Haas that the question vías not exclusively of a military character, pointed out that procedure in such cases would be much more satisfactory if and when the C.I.N.A. was put, as he had suggested, under the effective direction of the League.
M. SUdMURA thought that the C.I.N.A. liad done excellent technical work, and that the political difficulties which had been observed in its first years had tended to disappear in recent years.
M. DDF OUR-HER ONCE said that the Secre tary-General had asked him to preside over the Secretariat Committee to consider the League’s relation with the C.I.N.A, He proposed to convoke this Committee shortly.
K. HAAS
-4
(e)	0	M* HALS said that there might he added to the Agenda
later a report of the Transit Committee on communications in time of crisis.
M. de MADARIAGA thought that it would be better that separate reports on various aspects of the question of communications in time of crisis should not be presented to the Council.
Re suggested, therefore, that no item should be placed on the Agenda until it was known exactly what questions were to he dealt with or alternatively a loose drafting which would allow one paper only to be presented.
M. HAAS agreed, and said that there would be only one report which would be supplementary to the information already given to the Council.
(f)	. After discussion» it was agreed that an item should be inserted in the Agenda regarding the Third General Conference of the Transit Organisation.
(g)	,	IT. HAAS said that the Convention of the International
Relief Union, which had recently been drawn up, implied certain action by the league. Should the Council be informed forthwith., or only after the coming into force of the Convention, of the duties which the league was being asked to undertake?
It was agreed that the item should he placed on the Council Agenda forthwith.

It was agreed that, in order to relieve him of
further work, the Roumanian Representative might be substituted for the Chilean Representative as Rapporteur for Item 11 (Establishment of Armenian Refugees)..
(i) .	1A HAAS asked whether any report might be enpected
on the question of help for certain further classes of Refugees which had been raised at the last session of the Assembly?
MR. V/ALTERS said that this question could only be referred to the league by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office»
Hr. BISTER said that the Governing Body had decided to go into the question only at its October session.
(J).	It was agreed that the report of 3>r. Hadsen on his
visit to South America should appear on the Agenda. The report could be communicated hy him, as President of the league Health Committee, to the Secretary-General, who could then submit it to the Council.
(k).	The ACTIHG SECRETARY-GENERAL naked that all Rapporteur1
reports might be prepared at the earliest possible moment.
M* DUROUR-REROiiCE drew attention to an entract from the Polish paper, "Glos Brawdy" , which had appeared in the Press Review of the 23rd July, on the subject of the choice of Herr Eulz as President of the Conference on the International Relief Union. The article stated that Herr Eulz had been on the list of "War Criminals" , that Herr Eulz should have formally refuted the charges brought against him as a "War Criminals before accepting the Chair for the Conference, and that the -
L
r- 6	-
Council, "before agreeing to proposals for appointments made by the Secretariat, should enquire into the "valeur morale" of candidates. M. Dufour-Feronce then read a statement (Anne::) shewing that the Leipzig Court had exculpated Herr Eulz, and said that ho wished to record his emphatic opinion that the Press Review should not reproduce allegations of this kind against individuals acting in the service of the league, who could not themselves reply. Incidentally, he would have thought it expedient, had he known that Herr Eulz was on the list of so-called War Criminals, to deprecate his nomination. The main point, however, was that such things should not appear in the Press Review, and in cases of doubt, he thought that the Information Section would be well advised to consult some member of the Secretariat of the same nationality as the person incriminated.
The ACTI1M SECRETARY-GHH3RAX agreed that it was regrettable that this article had appeared in the Press Review, especially as the person concerned has been invited by the Council to take the chair of a League Conference. He would suggest that the Information Section might, in future, consider whether it should not merely say that Mr. X. had been criticised in an article in such and such a paper, without reproducing the article.
li. HE YUAN said that it was in order to be relieved of the responsibility of commenting on allegations of this kind that the Information Section reproduced the text of articles rather than summarised them.

AICH! c
The Reich Attorney-General1 s corarnunice tion to the Ministry of the Reichswehr regarding the discontinuance of the proceedings against II, Euelz, Reich Minister, is as follows: With regard to the investigations in connection with the proceedings instituted against Burgomaster Euelz, retired Major of the Reserve - Pile Il0o36/23 - I have the honour to state in reply to your communication of May 5th, 1925, 11 oo 30,5 »25. TJA», that 1 have ordered the case to be dropped..
According to the Havas message the accused is charged with the following crimes:
1)	Arrest of a priest named Barbier and his father at BlAnont on September 9th, 1914;
2)	Theft of a sum of money in gold francs from the priest’s house at Blsmont;
3}' Theft of church ornaments from the church at Donèvre ;
4) Destruction of the church at Earboney on September 30th,
1914.
The following are the facts ascertained with reference to these accusations:
Ad 1).The priest and certain other persons were arrested on suspicion of espionage, but were immediately released when there were found to be no grounds for suspicion. The accused was in charge of the enquiries *
Ad 2). On the occasion of the search of the priest's house necessitated by this enquiry the accused and his staff found sums of money in gold francs, which were changed into paper marts in accordance v/ith official regulations and handed over to the army authorities through the paymaster.
8
Ad 5) . At the time when the accused arrived at Domevre the place was already completely destroyed, and it is therefore impossible that any church ornaments could still have been there.
Ad 4). The church tower at Harboney was demolished by pioneers at the orders of the divisional commander, because it was used aa an enemy observation post. 2he accused had nothing to do with it.
Accordingly, the enquiries made by the home authorities failed to furnish the required evidence of any punishable offence committed by the accused.
IIo further material for investigation is to be expected from Prance.

He asked the Secretary of the meeting to draw the attention of any Sections not represented at the meeting to the request which he had made.
2.	In reply to II. Dufour, Mr. ROUTING said that there would he one Danzig question on the agenda in addition to the five already inserted. The new question was that of the port ¿’attache. A procedural question had also arisen with regard to the possibility of the insertion of another item, which would he submitted to the acting President of the Council.

in the press of manifestations by communists in the Saar. The police had at first received instructions to refrain from using violence, but in the end had drawn swords and wounded eight of the manifestunts .
4.	Mr. JACRUIT said that M. Hederbragt was here and was examining with special care all printing expenses.
M. NSYLLAN asked whether it would be proper to discuss at the meeting the reasons set forth by M. ds Jouvenal in the ,TMatin7T for his refusal to belong in future to the French delegation to the Assembly.

LI. de MADARIAGA said, that he had cone across less misunderstanding than he had expected to find.
Ur. WALTERS said that his information tended to show that in England at any rate the man in the street did consider the failure of the Conference as a League failure»
The ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL said that as the Conference followed the work: of the Preparatory Committee and was itself held in Geneva, it was inevitable that many people
should make the confusion.
M. de MADARIAGA said that it would he easy for the Assembly to show that the League had no technical responsibility for the Conference. On the other hand what was of importance was that the methods adopted by the Conference had not been those of the League. There had been less preparation and less patience. However it would appear discourteous to the conferring powers if the Assembly were to dwell openly on these facts.
7 .	II. DHPOUR-HERONCE said that it was the desire of the
Committee on Intellectual Co-operation that M, Lorentz should represent it before the Second Committee of the Assembly. He wished, however, to attend a scientific conference to be held at Como and subsequently at Rome from about 8-18 September.
Would it be possible for him to appear before the Committee before or after those dates, preferably before.
The ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL said that though it was the practice for the Chairmen of the more important Committees to be invited to be present during the session of the Assembly so as to give any information that might be needed on the work
4
of their Committees, they had no special mission to address the Committees. It would he for the Second Committee itself tt express the desire to hear Professor Lorentz and it could hardly do this until it had actually had under consideration the report on the work of the Intellectual Co-operation Committee.	Eovsiever the Committees might begin their
meetings on the 7th and it was perhaps possible that the Chairman of the Second Committee might so arrange the timetable that Professor Lorentz should appear before it on the 8th or 9th at the earliest.

1)	The SBCESTA11Y-GESTER/J* said that there would he dis-
tributed for discussion at the next Directors' Meeting a draft programme for the opening of the ¿assembly and also a draft statement by the President regarding the distribution of items on the .agenda. He would also ash Mr* Huston to submit a draft of the rules for order ia the Assembly Hall.
He hoped that at the forthcoming session it would be
2.
possible to appoint a member of the Legal Section to follow tho work of each of the Committees.
He thought that there would certainly be a close debate in the Third Committee on the subject of disarmament and that there would also be a thorough discussion of the results of the Soonomic Conference. It looked as if these two sub jests would be the chief concerns of the session.
2)	The SEC HIT AH 1- GLEHRAL remarked that in uninstructed
quarters, the breakdown of the Haval Conference vias regard-ed &s a blow th the league. He did not see that anything could be done to avoid this. In welcoming the choice of Geneva as the meeting place of the Conference, he had fully intended that the League should share the kudos of the expected success; so it seemed not unreasonable that it should share some part of the odium of the actual failure,
2)	The S SC HE T AKY - CEfEEAL wished the meeting to consider
the procedure which should be adapted for the final decision regarding the new building, as a basis of discussion, he put forward his own view, namely, that the assembly might set up a special Committee of 5 to 7 Hecibers, preferably belonging to countries none of whose Jmtionals appeared among tire prize-winners, to consider the question in all its aspects. It seemed clear that the Chairman of the Supervisory Commission should be a member ox such a Committee The Committee should be free to seek technical advice from whomsoever it wished. The Commattee could be set up as a result of early reoanmendati on by the General Committee of the Assembler. The building question was one which would excite the artistic instincts of some Delegates and the saving instincts of most, and he wished to have as little responsibility as possible for the final decision.
-3-
The DEPUTY SUCRE T TRY - GEIIER Al drew attention to the fact that the jury of architects had not helped the Assembly by pointing out in detail the respective merits, financial or technical, of the various plans, and in these circumstances he thought that the procedure proposed by the Secretaiy-Genera 1 was wise.
The MARQUIS PaUIUCCI PI CaLBOLI said that he had at first felt that the Building Committee as originally constituted might be the body most suited to advise the Assembly in this matter but, after reflection, he concurred in the view expressed by the Secretary-General and Deputy Seeretary-General.
The SECRETARY-GEUERAI said that the Assembly Committee might decide to refer some of the questions involved to the Building Committee.
In reply to M. de MADARIAGA, the 3ECRST1RY-GEIIERAI. said that he did not think it advisable to think out the solution whi ch the Committee might be hoped to propose .
In reply to Mr. GILCHRIST, the SECRETARY-GEMSRA1 said that, in his opinion, the Committee should report to the full Assembly, which would then refer the financial aspects of the question to the Fourth Committee.
M. SUGIKU3A emphasised the importance of appointing to the Committee Delegates of standing who were well acquainted with the work of the League and the needs of the Secretariat.
K. DUECURr-FERCTTCE suggested that the Iresiaent
of....
-4-
ofthe Assembly might he the Chairman of the Committee.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that this might be a good thing, except for the difficulty that the President's time was rather fully occupied. It might be that the Committee itself would appoint its own Chairman.
In reply to M. DUE OUR-PER CNCE, the SEC RE In 7f-GENERAL said that he did not think it useful at the present state to consider what v/ould happen if the proposed Committee did not reach an Agreement. He asked Marquis Paulucci to prepare the necessary documents for the General Committee.
4}	M. HAAS said that the forthcoming Trana t
Conference would be attended by strong Delegations from the U.S.A. and Turkey. He also explained the circumstances in which the U.5.S.R. had first accepted and then declined the invitation.
5)	Mr. G GIB AIT asked the lecre taiy-General whether
he was able to give an opinion on the point whether there would be an interval of 10 or 14 days between the early and late sessions of the Council which would be held concurrently with the Assembly.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it would largely depend on the date of the election of the new Members.
If this election was held immediately after the Debate of the Council, the new Council might begin to work seriously on its Agenda by the 14th or 15th.

A nun1er of changes of detail ere rade, which Hr. Wilson was asked to embody in a revised edition of the no te .
The following points also arose in the course of the discussion:
a) THE SEChETARY-GEwERATL said that a letter sho.ld be sent to the Acting President of t .e Council in his capacity of opener of tae Assembly Session, proposing
that Delegates might be informed that the Session would open $t 10,30 instead of 11 a_m. and of the reasons. A press communique might also be issued.

delegates should deal with his proposals on all four points set down for the meeting of Monday afternoon,
The note might also allude to the fact that, though in the distribution of items on the Agenda no item could go to the Third Committee , the debate on the work of the Council would presumably furnish the Committee with an item»
c)	The SEC HI] T ARY- GENERAL said that the President might also ask the Assembly to refer the question of the building, which did not appear directly on the Agenda, to the General Committee.

The following points also arose in the coarse of the discussion.
a)	In reply to Mr. Huston, the SECRETARi-GMERAl said that, though it would he impossible before the sanction of the General Committee had been obtained strictly to enforce the new rules, it might he useful to communicate to delegates on their arrival a note setting forth the proposals which were to he submitted to the Committee and explaining the fact that these were the result of the work of a Sub-Commit tee appointed by the General Committee of the Assembly at its last session.
b)	After some discussion on the q.uestion of the extent to which Members of the Secretariat might use the platform seats, the SSCRETARY-GM3RAL said that the principle he wished to see observed was that only those officials whose work was at the moment being discussed by the Assembly or those whose presence on t he platform was strictly necessary, should sit there. Moreover, a certain number of seats should always be kept vacant as it was particularly undesirable that officials should stand about on the platform. Officials ?/ho came merely to listen to the speeches should in no case sit on the platform but in the rear of the Hall
Mr. Huston was asked to make all possible efforts to reserve there sufficient accommodation for the Secretariat.
c)	In reply to Mr. Pelt, the SECRETIRI-SHiERIE said that the publication of the printed”press opinions” would be discontinued at the forthcoming session but that delegates should be informed of the existing press reviews prepared for the Secretariat so that they could receive copies if they desired.

1 ) Question oi the Brazilian Contribution to the expenses of the
Le ague,
The SLCMLTABY-GLIfhKAL, relerring to Directors’ Meeting Layer 11, summed up an interview he had had with the Brazilian Charge d’Affaires.
In answer tj a ruestion put by LI. Vaz ds i.ello, the Secretary-General had stated that, in his view, it was (<uite clear that the Brazilian contribution was not payable for the whole of the year' 1926, but only up to the a ate when the notice of withdrawal became effective (June loth). The Auditor was oi a different opinion and had suggested that the withdrawal of a member in the mi cdie of the year woulu put the League in a difficult financial position. It could be argued, however, that the notice of withdrawal only became effective alter two years which allowed sufi icient time to cake the necessary financial arrangements. It appeared legally imgos-ible, and it was certainly inadvisable, to asm a retiring Member to pay its contribution for the lull year when its notice of withdrawal took efiect in the middle oi the year.
2
Two further points arose in the interview which the cretary-General had with the Brazilian Chargé d’Aff aires :
a)	Would Brazil wish to go on contributing to the expenses of the Court and the International Labour Organisation? Prina facie it seemed she was entitled to do so» In the case of the I»L»0» there were precedents; States had been members of that organisation, without being Members of the League,
b)	What were Brazil's wishes in regard to the technical organisations of the League? It seemed that a country which ceased to be a Member of the League might continue to take part in the work of these organisations. Under the resolutions adopted by the Council and the Assembly
in 1920 and 1921 the term "technical organisation" covers the Economic and Financial, the Transit and the Health Organisations» There were however other organisations which could be regarded as being more or less on the border-line : Suppression of Traffic in Women and Protection of Children, Intellectual Co-operation,
Supervision of Opium Traffic, Progressive Codification of International Law,
The Secretary-General had given the Brazilian Charge d*Affaires a list of such organisations, and had indicated Brazil's full contribution up to June loth and the amount she would have to pay towards the upkeep, after that date, if she so desireu, of the Court, the I.L.C. and the various technical organisations of the League»
Since then he had felt doubtful, with regard to both the legal and the political aspects of the matter.
prom the legal point ci view, can a country withdrawing from the League remain a member,
3
a)	of the LLcO:?
b)	of the Court?
o) oi such technical organisations of the League as it wishes?
He would add that his impression was that Brazil was very anxious to contribute towards the upkeep of the Court,
Mr. MCiZIUliOE WOOL, after describing an Organisation as a body in the activities of which States Members participate, said such a definition applied only to the I.L.O. end the Transit Organisation,
a)	The Court was not an Organisation* Judges, not States, were the members of the Court. Brazil, when she ceased to be
a Member of the League, would remain a party to the Court Statute. The Brazilian national group in the Court of Arbitration would continue to nominate persons from among whom the members of the Court would he elected by the Assembly and the Council; but Brazil would not take part in these elections.
'.a regards the expenses oi the Court, Article 33 of the Statute decreed that they should be borne by the League,	Under
rticle 3b of the Statute the Court should be open to Brazil, as being a State mentioned in the .miner: to the Covenant; .and, if she was a party to a Dispute the Court would fix the amount she would have to contribute towards the expenses of the Court, -ccor dingly, if Brazil wanted to effect a yearly payment lor one upkeep or the Court such p :yment would, from a legal point of view, be a subsidy rather than a subscription. The Council •ivouId have to accept a - proposal from nrazil to that effect, and there was no uuubt that in the event of rrasil going before the Court as a party to a dispute, the Court would take into account the payment by Brazil of a yearly subsioy, when it had to apply the last paragraph of .'rticle 35 o:f the Statute, concerning the contribution of a state not a Member of the League.
b)	The position was different as regards Che
I.L.O. Abile
4
in the ease of the Court the subsidy offered by brazil tc assist the League should, ii accepted by the Council, be paid to the Secretary-General, brazil, il she continued to be a nc'ber oi the I.vL„0,, would pay her contribution uirect to that organisation (Article 22, paragraph à, oi the financial
Regulations oi the League), The question whether denunciation oi scribersbip or the League involved cessation of membership or the 1.1,0. was controversial. The first article of Part Till of the Peace Treaties r«aci:
T7The original Members of the ueaue oi nations
embers	of this	Organisation,
the Le	ague 0 f	hâtions shall
p oi th	e said	organisation."
uni t te d	to the	I.L.O. by the
rirst International Labour Oonference, as a result of a decision or the Peace Conference in favour of this admission. The question whether a State withdrawing from the League could continue to be a member of the I.L.O. without presenting a re guest to that effect, and also the cuestión whether such a request would be granted and which touy was competent to grant
it, could not be considered as settled by Article 22 of the
financial Regulations, which read;
"States, not members oi the League, which have been admitted members of any organisation oi the League shall, in the absence or any contrary provision, contribute towards the expenses of the organisation concerned as nearly ...........r;.
c)	As regards the technical organisations of the League,
the regulations concerning them had been aoupted by the hirst Assembly, when they wore "in process oi formation".
EL AS	pointed 0	ut	that States no	t Members of
b e me	Toers of	the	Transit Organ	isat ion, and
3 pa in	and iras	il,	he tûo'ic the v	iew that, as
Le
orawal from the Transit Organisation had not been contemplated as a consequence oi withdrawal from the League, a State which
a member or the League continued nevertheless to be
ceased to be
5
a member of the Transit Organisation,
mr. McZXli.-GiJ JOOD agreed that the Transit Organisation was the more developed, but the question whether any other organisation could be considered as being independent was complicated.
Dr, IIORHAJ iVHITL pointed out that in the case of the Health Organisation its advisory Council was the Committee of the Office international d’Hygiène publique, which is a body of government representatives. There were in that Committee governments which were not members of the Leagues
hr, x-oZIJJOU WOOD answered that membership of an organisation implied some powers in its management, and in that sense Governments were not members of the health Organisation.
The members of the Health Committee and other advisory committees of the League, except the Transit Committee, were individuals, not States,
Ho recalled the fact that after the Council had decided to set up an Advisory Committee for the Supervision of Traffic in Opium the Assembly had shown some nervousness as to a possible development of technical organisations into separate entities,
The type of organisation which was later developed was that of Advisory Committees,
1:. HjA3 observed that the .assembly had also adopted a re,'so Dation favouring tne development of technical organisations in the direction indicatea by the development oi the Transit Organisation.
The onOHnTAHY-OnJxxAAL thought that in view of the
éuplana	.t io 11	given by	liz. wcZiruion	Mocd, the safe legal	line
was for	h in	to confin	e himself tc	indicating to H> 7as	de ;c
what would be Brazil's contribution up to June lath 1928, and letting him know that if the Brazilian Government wanted to raise other questions as regards their participation in various organisations he would do his best to answer them.
-6-
ne desired, moreover, to have the opinion of the members of the meeting as to the questi on whether it vas politically desirable that a State could choose the organisation to which it desired to belong and refuse its contribution to the organisations in which it was not particularly interested.
It might be held on the one hand that a very dangerous precedent would be created if a State was allowed to make such a choice; with the result that contributions would diminish and a large category of States would, in the long run, only belong to certain technical organisations .
On the other hand, it might be of advantage that a State, after withdrawing from the league, should remain in close connection with its organisations. Such a State might after some time find it unsatisfactory not to be represented in the Assembly, and eventually the Council., which were the governing bodies of these organisations.
Mr. MchlNNON WOOD wanted to raise another legal point. Tie First Assembly had recommended that
"pending a further decision of the Assembly, it was desirable that Esthonia, latvia , lithuania and Georgia should, on presenting a request to that effect , be treated on the same footing as States Members of the league, as regards their participations in the work of the technical organisations of the league".
Tlis rec cmmendat ion provided for individual requests, and
probably action by the Council, in the case of those States not
Miembers of the League which desired to participate in the work
of the technical organisations.
M. HAAS pointed out that the Transit Conference, as it wag today constituted, was competent to admit such States into the Transit Organisation. As there was no doubt that such a request, if made by Brazil, would be granted, he wondered whether
-7-
it was not preferable simply to allow Brazil to remain in the transit Organisation, if she wished tc do so.
M. CATASTINI thought States should not be encouraged only to participate in such activities of the league as they thought advantageous. They should net be at liberty tc exercise such a choice. The recommendation of the First Assembly regarding Ssthonia, Latvia etc. provided for exceptional cases: Esthonia, Latvia ..... were States which had applied for membership of the League and whose requests had been adjourned for political reasons.
Mr. McKINNON WOOL agreed that the case of a State withdrawing from the league was different. He pointed out that another case would be that of a State expelled from the league. Such a State would certainly be expelled from ever;/thing.
M. PIETEOMARCHI thought that, while it might be advisable to admit into the Technical Organisations States which were not yet Members of the League, it was in the interest of the League to consider, in the case of a retiring State, that the League’s activities were a whole, and must be accepted or rejected en bl cc.	From a general point of
view he was in favour of closer connection between the Organisati. ens and the League.
M. MATH3NET agreed with MM. Oatastini and Pietromarohi.
M. COMEHT thought it dangerous to allow States to discriminate between activities which they deemed interesting for themselves and activities which they considered as being of little °r no interest. It seemed to him that the question raised by the Secretary-General was a constitutional question of primary importance , ’which the Council would very likely refer to the Assembly.
Z
-8-
Dr. NORITE = ijITIj said the Health Organisai! on was an integral part of the league.. He did not see the possibility cf belonging to the Organisation without being in the league.
Mr.. JAOKLIH thought the policy of allowing States to participate in the work of the Technical Organisations after withdrawing from the League would be langerous , as it might encourage distant States to avail themselves of its financial and other advantages. He pointed out that Brasil, when she sent her notice of withdrawal, made no reservation as to a possible participation in the work of the Technical Organisations. Moreover, the payment of a contribution to such organisations did not confer on a State any particular right, except as regards membership of the Transit Conferences.
M. von SOHMIE.CEN thought the question was of such importance that it ought to be referred to the Council and the As sembly.
Li. BEAÜMOET said he had at first been struck by the advantage of retaining Brazil in the Technical Organisati ons cf the League. In view of the observations which had been offered he now felt considerable hesitation.
M. ROST INC agreed with the previous speakers.
Mr* LOVE DAY agreed with Mr. McKinnon Wood., He pointed out that in the case of the Lconomic and financial Organisation, members consisted of individuals, not States.
M. HAAS said he would like to know the results of the enquiry which would be made into the position of Brazil as regards membership of the I.I.O. If it was decided that she could remain a member of the I.I.O. he thought that decision would also apply in the case of the Transit Organisation. The legal basis for such a decision in the case of the Transit Organisai! on was even stronger, as there was a text which expressly permitted the ad-mission of States net Members of the League into that Organisati on.
9
LI. VIGLoL thought that from the political point of view there would he no great disadvantage if a State withdrawing from the League remained a member of the I.L.O. nightly or wrongly, Governments and public opinion generally considered that the connections between the two institutions were very loose. On the contrary, it would be dangerous if a Government, especially that of a no n-nur o pc an country, could explain to its Parliament and people that it had withdrawn only from the political - chiefly Lux ope an - entanglements oi the League, but had succeeded in retaining all the benefits of international co-operation in technical, intellectual and social work afforded by the League, Such an announcement might create an atmosphea • of self-satisfaction and a feeling of holding a superior
position somewhat similar to that of the United States which might make return to the League very difficult. The severance of all connections with the League would, on the contrary, be felt by all those who appreciated or worked for international co-operation at Geneva, and they would very likely bo more active in urging their Government to abandon its policy of international isolation, .'hen he was in brazil ... Vigier had understood that the present Government desired the maintenance of the Brazilian members on the technical committees or the League. he pointed out that at the last session cl the Council, the Brazilian member of the economic Committee had been maintained, but that the President, ... Villegas, supported cy 1., Uzrutia and the rapporteur, ... Strcsemann, had said that if Brazil definitely withdraw iron the League the Brazilian member of the economic Committee should be replaced by another Latin -.merican member.	This seent d to indicate that there
would be a strong feeling among I.e ibers of the League against allowinn a State which had. withdrawn from the League to benefit by the aw ant ages derived irw . membership of technical
committees.
LG
The SlGILLTAHY-GLiLatAL decided that the Legal Section would study the following questions
Does denunciation cl mentorship of the League involve cessation ox mentorship of the I.L.U. and of the technical organisations directly dependent on the League; and what would bo the effect of such denunciation on the relationship of the denouncing ¡State towards the .Permanent Court of International Justice?
The Secretary-General added that he would write to M. Libert Thomas to invite him to delegate a legal adviser to undertaj.ee a joint study of this question, which would have to be brought to the Council, and, if necessary, to the
VT
is sen! ly
Work of the Secretariat in October.
The SxjCHLTAEY-GEULHAL thought it very desirable that next year the first fortnight - if not the whole month - of „October shoulv be left without any meeting of conference or committee. The various Sections of the Secretariat ought to keep this point in mind in making arrangements for the committee meetings for which they were responsible. It was understood, however, that the -Permanent mandates Commission would continue to hold its second yearly session at the end of October.
After the directors’ meeting the Secretary-General saw the Chef 6e Cabinet of the director 01 the I.L.O. As a result of tnat interview, which has been circulated, he decided that it was better for the time being tc forego a joint study and that the Legal Section should examine on their own responsibility the question put:

1) Secretariat of the Special Committee to consider arbitration and
security»
The SHOP IT AEY-G iiriF.il, referring to Directors’ Meeting Paper 10, said that though there was no great urgency for coming to a decision he would lidie to hold a preliminary discussion on the question of the secretariat of the special committee which was to he placed at the disposal cf the Preparatory Committee to consider arbitration and security.
He had proposed in the last paragraph, of his note that 'Ll. Sugimura if he were willing to do so, might become the Secretary of the new Committee, the work being prepared primarily by the Political Section, in collaboration with the legal and Disarmament Sections*1* The word 'primarily ? must be understood in the sense that the Political Section would be the effective secretariat of the new Committee*
Questions of internal organisation could easily be settled if the various ¿sections concerned were ready to work together. It was a matter of goodwill* It v/as clear, however, that one section must be entrusted with the whole co-ordination of the work of disarmament, which included the cognate questions of arbitration and security* The arrangement proposed would correspond with the plan adopted by the Assembly in which the Third Committee was the co-ordinating committee, out could refer questions to ether Assembly committees for advice. It had done so this year in the case of the first Committee; it might as well do it in the ease of the Sixth Committee* The opinion of the Pirst Committee had been embodied in the report of the Third Committee to the Assembly. Similarly the Preparatory Committee would refer questions to the new Committee on Arbitration and security and the opinion of the new Committee would be embodied in the report presented to the Council by the Preparatory Committee*
The Chief of the Disarmament section would be the general coordinating officer for all questions relating to Disarmament, Arbitration and security. He would equally be the secretary of the Preparatory Committee* 'h en the new7 Committee had been set up the effective secretariat work for it would be assumed by the Political Section, but it was very advisable that the mead of the Disarmament Section should attend all the meetings of the new Committee in order to have full knowledge of what was going on, and no decision would be taken by the secretariat of the new Committee without consulting the secretary of the Preparatory Committee *

- 3 -
TJhsn, on the other hand $ preparatory Committee it I Committee chould attend,
the reports of the new Committee came before would be desirable that the secretary of the in order to advise, if necessary, the
■cretary of the Preparatory Committee.
It seemed there could be no objection to thi )int of view of th.e internal arrangements of the I be criticized from outside. As to the exact n
s procedure
w'jGre u^r icut .ethods or co
from the ; nor could -ordination
be followed, it seemed better to leave the question to the heads of b Sections concerned than to try to tie them down by Lard and fast rules ph rules sometimes made for friction rathen than co-or.ination*
As M. Madariaga had asked that the proposed arrangements should be pcussed by various Directors the Secretary-General had thought it useful bring the question before the meeting, while the decision could be ftp one d until M. Madariaga r.ad had an opportunity of stating his views, he so desired.
It seemed that M. Madariaga held an opinion which was somewhat cessive, as regards the actual functions of the sections in the becreta-ft. M. Madariaga maintained as he understood it that the Political ttion was only concerned with concrete disputes or possibilities of such bites, and that all work of a theoretical character fell within the be of the Disarmament Section. Although such had been the case in the ft with regard to the study of Article 11 of the Covenant this view was rtainly exaggerated, neither the study of Article 11 not that of ;icle 15 could be said to be questions which had primarily a disarmament »set. It was very necessary to have for the time-being a co-ordinating ieer for disarmament ana cognate questions; but it would be a mistake t
^*7 in connection with the concrete case ti and fast rules for the inner working of
under discussion to lay down the secretariat.
M. 3UCILUBA agreed with the becretsry-Gene dual goodwill between the section- of t-ie bee lat the head of the
ral as to the necessity for retariat. He clso agreed
- 4 -
Pisarmement Section should he the general co-ordinating officer jjbr all questions connected with disarmament, as he was the Secretary of the Preparatory Committee.
Prom the point of view of internal organisation he wished to point out - though the point might appear somewhat theoretical - that there could he no parallelism between the Preparatory Committee and the Committee on Arbitration and Security on the one hand, and the Disarmament and Political Sections on the other. The Secretary-General alone was responsible for the organisation of the secretariat of all the meetings of.the League. Though he could delegate his powers to a particular official he was alone responsible to any committee of the League, and the officials to whom he delegated his powers were
responsible only ta him. Accordingly, both the Preparatory Committee
*
and the new Committee had, from the theoretical point of view, the same Secretary, viz. the Secretary-General ; and the Secretary-General, as secretary of the new Committee, could not be sâ d to be subordinated to the Secretary-General, as secretary of the Preparatory Committee.
This view was, he thought, theoretically correct. Practically, there was nothing in it to prevent co-operaticn between two Sections cf the Secretariat nor the recognition of the necessity, in this particular case, cf a co-ordinating centre, which was the Section responsible for the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee.
M.Suginura had understood the wrd "primarily" to which the Secretary-General had .just referred, in the sense that from the
point of view of the questions of arbitration and security dealt with by the new Committee the Political Section would be "primarily" responsible, Juet as the Disarmament Section would be "primarily" responsible for disarmament questions, both Sections being
responsible to the Secretary-General.
The two Sections would, in his view, closely co-operate in

ip amatory Committee had indicated
friendly spirit.
ho the new Committee the lines on which it weuLc have to work the new Committee would make an independent stud;/ and report to the Preparatory fconmittee. The work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security Ir.vould he autonomous, hut it would certainly be advantageous for the ¡.'Secretary of the Preparatory Committee to attend the meetings of the |n:w Committee in order, not to intervene, out to follow its proceedings.
ii.liATHBIoCT desired to expound the views held, by li.Iladariaga.
|She latter thought that to divide the work of the Secretariat between t70 Sections was perhaps to act contrary to the spirit of the resolutions :? the Assembly. It was difficult to distinguish, between disarmament proper and the cognate questions of arbitration and security.
There was no disarmament proper, as each time a question of disarmament ms considered a question of security arose. The most recent experience in this connection was the Geneva Daval Conference.
There would accordingly be a tendency for the Disarmament ¿ection not to limit itself to disarmament questions, but to deal nth problems of security, whether it wished to do so or not.
+:« ri t +
Up. to now, vh en the Disarmament Section felt incompeten
o
deal with certain problems, they were referred to other Sections of the Secretariat, and the Director of the Disarmament Section merely passed on to the Preparatory Committee the reports received iron, the other Section. It did not seem that this practice would be altered; transit questions would continue to be referred to the Transit Organisation. As ail reports must finally be submitted to the Preparatory Committee the fact of entrusting the Secretariat of the new Committee to a Section which was not the Disarmament Section onlv meant the creation of a new "echelon" in the procedure..
new
in the
- o
iis regards the creation of co-ordination, as the Preparatory Committee was entrusted with the co-ordination of the wor 1c of all organisations which worked for it, it appeared logical that the Secretary of the Preparatory Committee, whoever he might he, should co-ordinate all the work which had to be prepared for its meetings.
Moreover, though it was true that no Section was subordinated to another, it was necessary that one of them should he entrusted with the duty of preparing reports for the Council, with the help, if necessary, of another Section» The report on Communications in times of crisis, for instance, had been prepared by the Disarmsaent Section, with the help of the Transit Section.
The SECHSTIlHY - GENS PAL said that all disarmament questions came to the Council from the Preparatory Committee. The Section
which constituted the Secretariat <bf that Committee would accordingly be responsible for the presentation of its reports to the Council, and it would ask for the help of the Political Section in the ease of questions of arbitration and security.
The Secretary-General did not agree that there ware no questions of disarmament proper. There were questions which would be dealt with in the Disarmament Section without the services of another Section being required»
li.GOLEM agreed with the statement made at the beginning of the meeting by the Secretary-General. Ee did not see anything in the opinions exoreased by M.Suginura which was in contradiction with that statement. He also thought that what M.Lathenet had said did net alter the situation.
If, as was to be foreseen, disarmament was going to be a big problem in future years, it was important that the Political Section should be brought into the work in an organic way. In the

M.PDEi’KQLLtLiiCHI said that Llarquis Paulueci entirely agreed with the Secrctary-CeneralTs note. Security was a preliminary question, to be considered in itself, ana had a political character, This had been recognised by -at he not when he lead said that the Seneva ilav&l Conference had found itself face to face with the problem of security. The questions of arbitration and security had also a legal character, and it would be advisable if a member of the Legal Section attended the meetings of the new Committee. There ought to be no watertight partitions between Sections, in order that the Secretariat might serve the various
Committees of the League in the best manner possible

-8-
The snCESTARY-GSJSHAI. v/as inclined to apply in the case of tho Legal Section the general rules he had outlined. If a special Committee on arbitration was sat up, the Secretariat would be entrusted tc the Legal Section, Meanwhile, he was sure that a member of the Legal Section would attend the meetings of the new C ommittee0
2,1. STOPPAI? I agreed with the Secretary-General.
She SIC LITARY-CUT2EAL was glad of the general agreement which had been reached and hoped that under these circumstances M, Madariaga would not wish to reopen hie discussion at the next meeting.
I ) Question of the Participation of the U-,RJSoS0 in the
Preparatory Committee of the Disarmament Conference and in the Special Committee on arbitration and Security.
The S3ClP:TlKY-GEIiISAL, referring to Directors7 Meeting Paper 13, said the question under discussion was whether it was desirable that endeavours should be made to secure the partiel»» pation of the Soviet Government in the Preparatory Committee and in the Committee on Arbitration and Security.
After the Swiss and Soviet Governments had come to a settlement the question of sending a new invitation to the latter, foi? the Preparatory Committee, had been discussed in the DirectorsT meeting, and the conclusion had been reached that it was impossible to expose the League to a further refusal from Moscow.
The position had changed. It would now be possible to send the Soviet Government, for their information, a copy of the resolution of the Assembly setting up the new Committee
-9
on Arbitration and Security, with a reference to the original invitation to attend the Preparatory Committee, This would give them an opportunity to say that they had decided to tañe up the original invitation.-, As the question was very difficult it would he wise to think it over, and not to take any final decision until the following week at the earliest*
M0 SUGrlMDRA agreed -with the Secretary-General, from the point of view of security and arbitration, leaving aside that of disarmamento
From a general point of view it seemed that the question of oo-operation with Russia must he solved as methodically as possible^ It was better to begin by co-operation in technical matters, This would prepare a basis for co-operation in political and disarmament questions. Under present circumstances it did not seem that much could be expected from Russia as regards co-operation in this sphere0
As regards the Committee on Arbitration end Security, while Russia was rot interested in the question of the development of the articles of the Covenant, she was interested in the development of arbitration and security. It was necessary that Russia should not suspect the league of trying to bring about, especially in the case of States bordering upon Russia, arrangements directed against her. Though not much more could be expected, the representation of Russia on the Committee might help to allay this suspicion»
Finally, the question of tbo universality of the league must be taken into consideration* Universality must be a constant aim0 The procedure suggested by the Secretary-General furnished a means cf working for this aim, while leaving it tc Russia to decile as she thought fit*
-10-
The SECRETATJf-GSTERAl said that he had the impression that the Soviet Government would send representatives if they received some encouragement to do so« Perhaps the mere sending of the Assembly resolutions would suffice«,
II. BEm.tl.10HT thought that if Russia wanted to send representatives she would do so, even if she did not receive the Assembly resolutions,
The SECKES.hlY-GIISSIlAL did not think so. He thought that the question of psychology and therefore of form was very important in this case.
MATHEHST suggested as an alternative the procedure which had bean used in the case of the Economic Conference, viz, a press communique0
]£. von ¿CrE-IIEDIEJ thought that the co-operation of the Soviet Government was very important. They had made, and were mailing, treaties with their neighbours, the latest instance being the treaty with Persia. Treaties of non-aggression with Poland and France were also contemplated, and negotiations had been begun with the Baltic States« There was, accordingly, a danger of a separate system of agreements.
K. KATIE
IT said that
nent the Soviet Delegates,
from the point of view of disarma-if there Government decided to be
represented now in the Preparatory Committee, would arrive for the second reading of the draft convention, It was likely that they would not approve of the previous work, done in their absence, and would ask that everything should be begun all over
again, on a new basis
-11-
Mo SI 0PP11II said that, from his experience of the Economic Conierenco, Russian participation did not yield immediate resultst but that when their views were entirely different fron those held ty the other delegations the work of the Conference was in no way hampered0
He agreed with the Secretary-Geneial that the question of form was in this case more important than that of substance. Tlie Soviet Government had been invited to participate in disarmament work; the reason for their refusal had disappeared. It was very important that the Secretariat should show the consistency of the .League1 s policy by giving the Soviet Government another opportunity of statin g whether or not they wished to participate.
M. GO.- RâR agreed with the procedure suggested by the Secretary-General
M. COMÏÏRT thought thrt free the point of vie of public opinion the idea of discussing security and disarmament without Russia appeared paradoxical. It seemed necessary not to be exposed to the criticism of having lost an opportunity of securing Russia1 s co-operation. While agreeing with the procedure proposed by the Secretary-General, he wondered whether it was not possible to go a little further, and in the note to the Soviet Government not only to refer to the original invitation to attend the Preparatory Committee but even to inform them of the date of the next meeting.
She SRCRST.ftY-GELhRAl feared this would really be an indirect invitation — a proce :ure he hao. thought advisable tc avoid, as it might give the Soviet Government an opportunity of replying by another disagreeaole note»
-12«
Mra SIAM was in favour of giving the soviet Government every opportunity, without inviting them formally.
Mo P JETROMARC HI said that the problem of d is arms m on t could not he adequately dealt with if the Soviet Government was not invited«, Everything possible must be done to obtain the representation of all interested countries«, The question whether the participation of soviet Russia would facilitate or not the work of disarmament was secondary,
If their delegates hampered it the responsibility for their obstruction would lie with themselves entirely, M, von Gohmicdan had rightly emphasised the danger of a separate system of agreements. It would be important to co-ordinate the agreements concluded by the Soviet Governments vith those concluded by Members of the league according to the principles of the Covenant.
The BEG I1KT.&R Y-GiGllEBAL concluded that it was generally agreed that the Soviet Government shou .d be given an opportunity to reconsider their decision, without a formal invitation being extended to them«, A definite decision Ou the question would be postponed to the following we;!:«.

1. Question of the Participation of the U.3.3.R. in the
Preparatory Committee of the Disarmament Conference and in the Committee on Arbitration and Security.
The SECHETADY-G-EEEPA1 said that sines the last meeting the texts of the Council and Assembly resolutions had been examined, and it was clear that the Secretary-General had been instructed to send the resolutions
-2-
regarding arbitration and security to all Governments, Members of the league or not»
The question remained whether or not in sending these resolutions the Secretariat should prepare a special letter to the Soviet Government, calling their attention to the previous invitation to attend the Preparatory Committee. The Secretary-General stall thought that the right procedure was to forward a letter which would begin as follows
"With reference to letter	inviting
the Soviet Government to send representatives to the Preparatory Committee, I have the honour .......
M. SUGIMURA said he had asked M. von Renthe-Fink to attend the meeting. M. von Benthe-Fink had, at M. •SugimuraIs request, studied the question of the participation of the Soviet Government in the work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security, and might furnish interesting information.
M. von RED THE-FETE stated that iron information he had received it seemed that the work undertaken at Geneva in connection with disarmament questions was followed with interest in Russia, and certain elements were in favour of participating in that work. It was to be expected that the Soviet Government would take a decision with regard to this within a few weeks. It seemed that there was some connection between their decision and the Bolshevik Congress to be held in December. It might accordingly happen that the Soviet Government would not take a decision in time to send representatives to the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee to be held at the end of November, Would it be possible in that case for the Soviet government to send
representatives tc the first meeting of the Committee on Arbitration and Security, if they wished to do so?
The 31C3ETAEY-GSBSRAL said it was technically possible, provided that the Soviet Government decided to be represented on the Preparatory Committee as well.
Peousst from the Lithuanian Government, under Article 11,
The 3ECHETA1Y-GEIIUPJLI said the Lithuanian Government had presented an appeal to the Council under Article 11, ashing that various questions in dispute between Lithuania and Poland - which were almost entirely minority questions -should be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Council. The Lithuanian request constituted a more serious step than an appeal under the Minorities Treaty.
The Political Section would deal with the question, ana would consult and keep in close touch with the Minorities and Legal Sections.
Petition received from the Macedonian organisation.
The SECHETA5Y-G1&TERAL announced that a petition had been received from the Macedonian organisation protesting against the arrest of Bulgarian students in Yugoslavia. The petition had been forwarded to the Yugoslav Government - it had been considered that in virtue of a precedent established 'by a previous Minorities Committee of the Council the petition was receivable, though it had been sent by a revolutionary organisation.
The Yugoslav Government had, however, contested the reoeivability cf the petition on other grounds. It considered that no minority existed in Yugoslavia which fell within the minority regulations.
-4-
The question would be examined by the President and two other members of tho Council. It was to be noticed that the Yugoslav Government had answered on the substance cf the petition, and not on the question of form
Incidents on the Serbo-Bnlgarian Frontier.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said the two Governments were anxious to do everything to show goodwill, and there was no need to be alarmed by the situation. The Yugoslav Government had succeeded in calming public opinion.
Participation of the Government of tne U.S.A. in the Work of the Transit Organisation,
M. HAAS said that for the first tine the Transit Organisation would have the direct cooperation of the Government of the U.S.A. It would be represented for the question of tonnage measurement in maritime navigation.
The fact was due to the personal influence of the American representatives at the last Transit Conference, and it was important both from the point of view of the cooperation of the United States with tho League and of the settlement of dif fi cult technical que s tLons.
question of the possibility for States ceasing to be Members of the League to remain members of the Transit Organisation, The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked M. Haas to prepare a memorandum on the clause in the Statute of the Transit Organisation whereby it was permitted to maintain in the Transit Organisation States which had ceased to be Members of the league. As the Secretary-General read it the clause could eventually be interpreted to maintain States which had even been expelled from the League.

7. Gommunic at ions Conference at Washi ngt on -
At the request of Mr, Gilchrist, M. HAAS furnished certain information on the Conference. Various organisations had been invited to attend in a consultative capacity. The Transit Organisation of the League had not been invited; but this was not due to ignorance of its existence, and M. Haas did not think it would happen again. Moreover, there seemed to be no great loss in not being invited, as it would not have been tc the advantage of the Transit Organisation to be placed on the same list as other organisations attending in a consultative capacity. Further, the Washington Conference was purely technical,
3,	Progress of the Work of the Conference on Import and Export Prohibit!ons .
Mr. FE1KIU said that the Conference was proceeding satisfactorily; it was probable that the differences which had come to light during the first days fe.g. between Germany and France on the question of scrap iron) would be overcome.
The Conference was discussing a rather weak draft convention, which had been prepared two years ago. Article 5 of the draft read:-
"Nothing in this agreement shall affect the right of any contracting State to take, on importation or exportation, all necessary measures to meet extraordinary and abnormal circumstances, ana to protect the vital economic and financial interests of the State.........."
On the other hand, Article 7 of the draft Convention, relut ing
to the possibility of disputes arising between two or more
contracting States as to the interpretation or application of
the provisions of the Convention, stated that,
-6-
"should such dispute not be settled either directly between the parties or by the employment of any other means of reaching agreement, the parties to the dispute may, before resorting to any arbitral or judicial procedure, submit the dispute, with a view to an amicable settlement, to such technical body as the Council of the League may appoint for this purpos This body will give an advisory opinion ......
Strong objections had been raised to these articlesr
It would he useful to know whether such voluntary procedure
had been accepted before, or not.
M. HAAS referred to the piocedure adopted in Transit Conventions. He indicated the advantages of such procedure, which allowed of a more supple drafting of other articles.
Dr. RAJCHMAN referred to the procedure adopted in the case of bilateral Health Conventions, which had been accepted by the Council in July 1923,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said the Legal Section could undertake a study of the question put by Mr. Eelkin, in order to be ready to present a memorandum if and when the President of the Conference asked the Secretariat for such information.

1.	The meeting considered the draft provisional agenda
for tho 48th session of the Council (December 5th, 1927).
Item 3. "Establishment of an Administrative Btaff Tribunal. Memorandum by the Sedret ary-General" .
The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked the Legal Bectich to study the question whether he had to submit a memorandum, and in that case whether Item 3 should be taken by the Council before point 1 of Item 2, "Appointment of judges of Administrative Tribunal".
Item 5. "Traffic in Opium, Report of the Opium Committee on the work of its extraordinary session (October 1927	,
The SECRETARY-&EKERAL said he had. noticed a practice in this Committee to "authorise" the Secretariat to call the attention of Corerments to the fact that they had not given information on certain points, etc » The practice created an awkward position, as there was no resolution to this effect in the Committeers report to the Council, It would he possible this time to carry out the Committee rs recommendations, in an informal manner, but it was necessary to remind it that such recommendations should be sent to the Council.,
Dame Rachel Crourdy agreed . She was away &t the time, and there had been a misunderstanding.
Item 9* "Extension to ether categories of refugees of the measures tacen to assist Russian refugees’'.
Dane Rachel CROu’DY explained that this was a question for the International Labour Office.
The SECRET ARY--G-SRSEAL desired the words "Memorandum by the International Labour Office” should be added to the title.

He added that* as a general rule, whan the title of a question mentioned an Assembly resolution the text of the resolution should be annexed to the agenda»
Item 14, "Contributions in arrears. Report by the Secretary-General".
The question was adjourned to a later ordinary session of the Council probably that which would precede the September session*
Item 16. "Report of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference".
On the proposal of M. de MADARIAGA this item was deleted, as the Commission would not meet until a few' days before the next Council session.
» I
Item 18» "Financial assistance to btatae victims of aggression".
On the pfonosal of M. de MjiH&RIAGA, this item was also suppressed* as the new Committee on Arbitration and becurity would have to study the question»
Item 85. "Report of the Economic Committee".
Mr. LOVEDAY pointed out that the meeting of the Committee had been postponed till November 29th. The Committee would, however, take up questions on which urgent action by the Council might be necessary, s.g., the question of the relations to be established with the International Chamber of Commerce.
- 4 -
The SECRETARY-G3EERAL agreed that questions requiring immediate action should he taken at the December session of the Council# The others could he left ever till the first session in 1928» Item 25 might accordingly read as follows "Urgent questions arising cut ol the Report of the Economic Commit tee" .
Item 291 "Creation of an International Educational Cinematographic Institute".
M. PIETROMARCHI agreed that the question should he adjourned. He pointed out that tha Rapporteur should ha the representative of Italy.
Item 51. "Question of the Reduction of meetings of the Council from four to three"•
The SSORBIRRY-GEUERAli said that from a purely administrative point of view this reduction should, in his opinion, he an advantage. It seemed also to he an advantage from the point of view of technical organisations. Pram the political point of view the question was controversial#	It would ha
noticed however, that though the last Council session was closed at the end of September the agenda for the next session was very heavy, which gave a certain amount of justification to the case in favour of four meetings a year# Moreover, if the Council met four times a year it was less likely that it would he necessary to have a special session for urgent political questions. It might he argued, on the other hand, that it was better to have a special session than to have important political questions mixed up in a big agenda.
It was possible that the Council would adjourn the question of the number of its meetings# In view of tne fact that the annual period as regards the work of the Council had already legun, it might not he unreasonable for the question to he postponed till next September.
- 5 -
The SECRETAKT-GENERAL asked that when the agenda had been finally settled the Directors and Reads of Section should endeavour to issue as soon as possible the necessary memoranda by the Secretary-Oeneral and to prepare and forward draft reports to the respective rapporteurs at the earliest date. The general trend of thought in the Council was that rapporteurs should circulate their reports to their colleagues some time before the meeting of the Council »
The SEC RET ARY-GENER AX informed the meeting of the exchange of telegrams which had taken place between the Lithuanian Savamment, the President of the Council and the Secretary-Genaral. The Lithuanian Government h ai telegraphed to the President of the Council that 11 Polish nationals had been banished by the Prlish Government and were on what the Lithuanian Government called the "line of demarcation". The Se c ret ary-Gene ral ked thought it right to advise the President of the Council t« reply that the Lithuanian telegram would be sent found to the members of the Council for their information, in order that the Council might, if the Lithuanian Government so desired, consider the question at the same time as their former request under Article 11*
M. Voldemar as answered that he agreed to the proposal to place the question bn the agenda of the Council session.
The Secretary-General replied that no such pronoeal had been made and the Lithuanian Government must take the initiative and responsibility for it. The answer from M. Voldemaras had just been received. It was to the effect that the Lithuanian Gavern-ment requested the Secretary-General to place the question on the agenda under the same head as the request under Article 11.
-6-
Gertsin criticisms had been made in the Polish press.
It seemed that the opinion was held that the telegram from
)
M. Voldemaras should not have been accepted, that the Secretariat could not be considered as being simply a "post-office", and that it was required to exercise discretion. This was correct to a certain extent. If, for instance, a Goverment used inflammatory language, the Secretary-General might before circulating a complaint draw its attention to the gravity of its action, but, ha would have to inform the Gouncil if the Government insisted on the circulation of the complaint.
Dr. RAJCHMAN said there was no doubt as to the duty of the Secretary-General under Article 11. It might even be useful to have a special meeting of the Council in the oase of sn appeal under Article 11. In the case of the exiles the Polish press had said there were precedents when no action bad been taken.
They had mentioned the case of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
The SECRETARY-GEHERAL said that at that time it was clear that the Bulgarian Goverment was using the Secretariat as a channel for propaganda, and as far as he remembered the question was not before the Council.
Dr. RAJCEi/AK thought also that two or three years ago there had arisen the case of a note by Persia, relating to an sxchange of correspondence between Great Britain and Russia. In his view such notes, although not accompanied by speoifio requests, should be circulated. In the case of an appeal under Article 11 ha questioned the advisability of the Secretariat having to exorcise discretion.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed that the Secretariat must take action, when Article 11 has been invoked.
-7-
Appointment of members of the Saar Basin Governing Commission,
M. MISBLJ raised the question whether this item should not be placed on the agenda of the next Council meeting
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said the question oould not be settled until the Council had decided whether it would hold three or feur annual sessions. If necessary, the terms of of'fioe of the present members oould be prolonged by the Gounoil for one month, if it deoided not to most in March 1928 M. MISELJ asked whether the Permanent Court at the Hague would be likely to furnish an opinion on the question of the jurisdiction of the Dan*ig Courts in time for the next Council meeting. He understood that under the procedure of the Permanent Court the time-limit for depositing written Statements expired on November 4th.
The SECRETARY-GÏÏ1ERAL did not think that the Council oould take up the question in December.
Mr. JACKLIN would like to draw attention to the continued growth of the contributions of States Members. At the last Assembly he had got into touch with many members of the Fourth Committee. Several of them were sure there was an absence of a spirit of economy in certain League Organisations. It was necessary to remove this feeling as far as possible.
Moreover, in connection with the plan for providing financial support to States victims of aggression there was the possibility that States would be called upon to give financial guarantees amounting to twenty times their contribution to League expenses. He was afraid that the adoption of this plan might result in some Members reconsidering the question of their membership.
-8-
The SSGRE TAR Y - GE KEH AL had the feeling that the increase of financial burdens might lead some States to find reasons to discontinue their membership, while they would seldom give the true reason, which was the financial one. He agreed that the Technical Organisations should hear in mind that their arrangements affected States which at present at least were not in a strong financial position.
jks regards the Finnish scheme, it must be remembered that it was part of a general achome of disarmament - that was at loast the British point of view - and it might also be explained that a scheme of that kind, whiah imposed obligations, would have to be acoepted by each State. It was a question not of compulsory but of a voluntary guarantee.
Mr. JAGKLIlf pointed out that if some States stood out the burden would be heavier on those who agreed to the sc heme.
M. de MADARIAGA. said he was not much impressed by agreements of a financial nature, in the case of the League.
The latter would always hare before it the danger constituted by uninformed opinion. What was true was that the League was one of the cheapest concerns; but just as there were individuals who would not realise that an insurance premium was a good investment, there would also be people who would not understand the value of insurance against war. They would gradually be converted, and it wauld not be good policy to sacrifice the spirit in order to meet the views of people who were financially minded. Moreover, when people criticised the cost of the Finsnoial Organisation, for instance , it was possible to show them how the investors got their money back in concrete cases, like Austrian reconstruction.
9 -
Mr. JACKLIN said he was only preoccupied by a practical difficulty, viz: the danger ox States withdrawing if this sort of financial imposition was carried on.
The SECKETilJ-GERSRAL, while pointing out that there was no question of imposition, agreed to the nooessity of prudent action.
M. BORDET pointed out that the Finnish proposal had to bo adopted either by the Disarmament Conference or a spacial Conference.	More over, what was contemplated was
a guarantee for eventual loans constituted by a general guarantee and by a super-guarantee i rom countries in a strong financial position.
The SECRETARY-GEilMRAL agreed as to the first point, concerning the prooeouro necessary for the adoption of the scheme. As regards the second point, be pointed out that bonds would have to be deposited.
M. de MADARIAGA pointed out that there was no question of a deposit in oash.
Mr. LOVEDAY was a little perturbed, in view of the connection contemplated in the Finnish schemo between gu&rantoas and contributions under the scale for the allocation of the expenses of the League. This connection might make the question of allocation more difficult. He did not think: any financial plan should hang on the allocation scale.
The SECRET ARY-GERERAI said the point raised by Mr. Loved ay was of groat import anos and should be seriously

h n cm r h r rvrmrm n i n. n t i nr* *
TTa hfiiifived that iri thin rartinuiar
2
oase a member had moved to have a preliminary discussion on a proposal without committing the responsibility of his Government as to the proposal. Though such a proceeding might present advantages, it did not seem that the representative of a Government on a Committee could divest himself of his official quality.
M. SUGIIvfJRt pointed out that Committees formed to s certain extent corporate bodies, in which it was advantageous that discussion should be as free as possible. It might sometimes be of advantage that discussions on very delicate matters in which the political element was predominant should be kept confidential.
A somewhat similar cose in this respect seemed to be that of a sub-committee of the Council. It seemed that a permanent delegation at Geneva could not. ask for confidential documents prepared for cr by that sub-committee, although one of their nationals sat on it. The same was true, it seemed, in the case of a sub-committee of the I'reparetory Committee for the Disarmament Conference.
The SSCP3TAPY-GDÎTDRÀL agreed with ID Sugimura as regards sub-committees. '71. e n the Council appointed a sub-committee, the members were representatives not of their Governments, but of the Council. Whatever ruling might be decided upon as regards communication of confidential documents of committees w'ould not, he thought, apply to documents of sub-committees.
Dr. Pal J OH Hi!; agreed that a leggue committee could not be dcmpared with a sub-committee of the Council. He submitted, however, that Government delegates on Committees were members plenipotentiary and that documents had accordingly to be sent to them, the Secretariat not being entitled to send copies direct to their Ministries for Foreign Affairs.
There was, moreover, a
considerable danger in sending a series of documents without the necessary explanations. Such explanations could only be furnished by the Government1s representative on the Committee, and it was accordingly for him to forward the documents to his Government on his ov/n responsibility.
The SECE3TARY- Cg.TvERAL said that if a plenipotentiary asked that all accumenes should be sent to his Delegation, the Secretariat could not but comply with his request, It would have also to comply in the case of a Government informing the Secretary-General of the name of their representative on a Committee and asking that all documents should be forwarded to him.
M. de MADARIAGA agreed with Dr. Ranchman. He wanted moreover to point out that another source of difficulties was to be found in rivalry between national Departments. In disarmament questions, for instance, national defence Departments wore acting independently of Foreign Offices. It would even be advantageous to strengthen the procedure according to which the P.AoC, should be the channel through which all work connected with military questions should be sent to Governments.
It would accordingly be advisable for the Council to decide that if and when a Government was officially represented on a Committee, all documents should be forwarded to its representative on that Committee.
Dame RACHEL CROWDY pointed out that the adoption of the Polish point of view would lead to enormous difficulties in the case of the Opium Committee. It would be dangerous to send >6 Governments half-completed results of seizures of drugs.
The procedure would lead to cooperation, outside the League, between the Governments concerned. Dame Rachel wanted,norcoyer, to recall that she had only once distributed to Governments a
~4~
very private document, namely Part II of the report drawn up by the Experts Committee on Traffic in Women. That document had got into the "Daily News"* It was almost certain that it had leaked out through a Government Department. She finally pointed out that it wad likely that no minutes of private meetings would he kept, if these had also to he distributed»
Di'o RA.JGEIOLH wanted to add that his experience of committee work proved that a paper was often misunderstood by the members of the committea themselves, and had to be cleared up by discussion. It was accordingly dangerous to circulate committee documents to Governments beforehand»
M. BOH.SET thought that it was impossible to refuse to deliver documents to the secretaries of official delegates, who, as the Polish note pointed out, had been appointed to assist him in his work»
M, COMER! agreed« Any argument used to explain such a refusal would only create, in his view, a feeling of mistrust,
Dane RACHEL CR0Y07Y pointed out that there were in the case of the Opium Committee private meetings, with private, minute s, of which there was only one copy. If a certain number of copies had to be distributed there would be more chances for the contents of these minutes to got out,
M. P IE TRGtlA SC HI understood that these minutes contained discussions concerning documents which had been communicated by various Governments, If a very delicate question had to be discussed there would be a very private meeting, without any minutes being taken. But, as the duty of every Government representative wah to keep his Government informed, the latter was criitled to receive all documents which would be distributed.
- 5 -
Dane. R.lC£Ei CKCWI'Y pointed out that there were oases when it was advisable to observe the utmost secrecy for instance, when the police was investigating a case of drug traffic „
Lis. Pi?TBOI'A.'RGIil pointed out that Governments could be relied upon tc observe secrecy in suoh cases*
M. HIAII pointed out that in the case of the Transit Organisation the ruling, if it was adopted, that Governments were entitled tc receive confidential documents communicated to their representatives might in certain cases lead to object ions cn the part of certain Governments. He accordingly feared that such a ruling would result in the restriction cf the circulation of documents tc the members cf the Transit Committee and hamper their work*	It might also ba
argued that the eighteen members of the Transit Committee
represented not	cn 1 y t he ir G evernment s ,	but	t he	fif' y-f cur
States Hem be rs	of the ne ague » V. culd	a 11	t he	nations be
accordingly entitled tc receive all documents?
Dr. RÄJ0EMAH thought there was a differente between documents prepared for the use cf Governments and those prepared with a view to their being examined by a Technical Committee. Technical Committees had to try to facilitate co-operation between Governments . This co-operation would often be made mere difficult if all documents were distributed to G st ernmon ts »

	id	. BOH HE I	was sure that	if the question	w as put t o
the	G ounc il	the lat	ter would say	th at Gover nme n ts	were
ant	it led to	receive	the documents	a ommuni cat d t o	the ir
representatives.
The GSCEBlPRY-GSHfEil agreed. He did net see that it was possible to avoid complying with the request sx the Polish Government. The best course seemed to be to deal with it as a single and distinct request. It might be possible to answer that the present procedure had been adopted in view of certain difficulties which had occurred. Henceforth, however, since the ¿dish Government so desired, a copy cf every document sent to Polish official representatives on league Committees would be sent to the Polish Delegation in Genova. k slip stating that the document in question had been sent to the Polish representative on such and such a day would always be attached by the Distribution “Branch tc the copy sent to tbs Polish Delegation.
M. SUGBiUHA agreed. There right, however, be exceptional cases, when, for instance, a member would want ts make a. proposal tc his colleagues alone, and would net make it if he knew that it vc ul d be distributed outside. He was think-
ing of such Questions as drug traffic or licensed houses, ^legates personally wanted to make progress, and their position would in certain oases be made difficult if Governments were immediately informed. Agreement in the Jornmi ttee might
also be made mere difficult.
The 3ECRÏÏTPRY-GSHEEÀ1 oases it would be for the Commit circulation cf a document,, and i: asked for, the Secretariat would

(2} Sending to t he Members of the leagae ef_ Cinsulate Letters forwa.rding Resolutions_ of the Assernbly.
Tire SEC RE1ARY-G1JTEEAL, referring to Directors1 Meeting-paper 14, said the present procedure was to send circular letters for such resolutions cf the Assembly as fell within the following categories
a) resolutions asking for definite replies
(Gov rnments1 observations or views on such and such a question);
t) resolutions drawing attention to the
importance cf taking definite action, such as ratification of Conventions;
c) resolutions approving of the work performed by such and such Committee and expressing the hop® that Governments would give serious attention to its recommendations.
It v/as clear that such resolutions as fell within the first category should be sent separately., As regards those falling within the two other categories, the Secretariat had taken the line that they should also bo sent round in tho fora of circular letters, because the system of circular letters made it easier for the various Government departments concerned tc be informed of Assembly resolutions, It was now suggested as an alternative, in the case of resolutions of the third category, and perhaps also cf the second, that the collection of Assembly resolutions, known as the Brown Book, should be sent round, with a severing note calling attention to such resolutions as should be brought to the notice of Governments. It was argued that it would be of advantage to confine the use of circular letters to such Assembly resolutions as required
definite answers
« 8 -
Ho CUGXMURA said his experience as a former Chief of the Japanese League of Nations Office was that it was easier to receive a separate letter for each Assembly resolution.
This procedure facilitated transmission to the Government Departments concerned,,
Me GALAS TIN I agreed with M. Suginrara.
M. ROSTING- wondered whether it would not be possible to send a nere "note verbale” for such resolutions as did act require a definite answer»
Me de MA1RIAGA agreed with M. Resting»
MM. STJGIMTJRA and PIETROMARCHI insisted on the importance of signature.
M. TEIXIDGR suggested it would be advisable that in all eases ciroiar letters should mention the name of the Section concerned. This would be useful for purposes of classification.
The SECRE1ARY-GENERAL agreed. He concluded that the present procedure had better be maintained.
^presentation of the Soulst_ government on the Preparatory Committee of the Pisarmamenf Conference» * i
The SEC IETARY-GENERAL said the Soviet Government had now a&cepted to be represented on the Preparatory Committee. It should be made clear that what the Soviet Government had accepted
i
wa.s the previous invitation which had been sent to them on bcjaalf of the Council, an invitation which they had not accepted the time in view of their difficulties with the Swiss Govern-sent, but which still held good.

t) Appointment of a Secretariat Committee to consider certain .questions referred to the Secretary-General by the Special Committee on the Hew Building,,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL, referring to Directors1 Meeting paper I§, said the special Committee appointed by the Assembly had met.
7oey had decided in absolute secrecy to proceed to the elimination °f certain plans and concentrate on certain others. As two members out of five had been unable to attend the meeting at Geneva their
- 2
colleagues had gone to Paris to consult with. them. It would not be until this consultation had taken place that the Secretary-General would ho informed of the plans which the Committee had thought worth retaining for further stiidy«
The plans which would tiros he retained would he submitted to a small hoard of three architect»*, who would he appointed hy the European members of the Commit toe of Five., The architects would have to furnish technical information on points which had been specified hy the Committee« Moreover, the Secretary-General had been ashed to furnish observations from the administrative point of view on certain points * He was anxious to set up as soon as possible a committee of the Secretariat, which, together with a representative of the 1,1,0c, would study these points and submit a roport if possible by the end of the following week.
The members of the Secretariat Committee would of course be on a footing/ equality« It was to be hoped that they would be able to issue a unanimous report; but, if this proved impossible, dissentient opinions would have to be registered« The duty of the Secretariat Committee would be to take the plans referred to them by the Committee of Five and state on objective _grounds, without expressing preference for any plans, which advantages and defects each plan had from the administrative point of view under the various heads considered.«
The Secretary-General proposed to constitute the Committee as follows
1)	Mar puis Pauluoci, who would be the chairman of the Committee, as the Secretary-General would be unable to attend.
2)	A member of the 1,1,Oc, to be designated by the Director
of the 1.1.0
3
3)	la-. Hus ton*
4)	M.Comert, in view of the importance ox press accommodation.
5)	II. Co It an, in view of his long experience ©f Secretariat work.
6)	Mr.Lloyd, who will act as Secretary.
LI.CQLBAN was a little upset at the idea of the Secretariat zoning in to present ohserrations at such a late stage,
M.AYE1TOL, while sharing K. Colban Ts view, thought it was very difficult for the Secretariat to refuse to ^.nsv/er the questions put to it by the Committee. He agreed with the Secretary-General as to the persons who should constitute the Committee. He thought they should he able to agree on a well-balanced opinion, which would represent, hot the personal impressions of various members, which individually they were of course entitled to form, hut- an impartial mean between probably rather divergent views.
M.TEIXIIOR asked whether Sections of the Secretariat could send suggestions to the Committee. He pointed out that the composition of some sections iiad been greatly altered since they bad sent information about their needs.
ii.AVEHOL pointed out that the Committee had not to examine plans on the basis of present needs. It could only take into Account the needs of the Secretariat as they had been explained to the competitors in the programme.
4
Marquis PAULUCCI agreed. The time for the various Sections to submit suggestions would be when a plan had been selected by the Committee of five.
M* SUGrIHJRA suggested that it might be advisable, from the point of view of outside opinion, that the I.1.0. should designate as its representative on the Secretariat Committee a member belonging to a nationality other than those of the members already designated.
Marquis PAULUCCI pointed out that the I.1.C. representative would have to give an opinion on the Assembly hall only.
The SlCR-fPARY-G.AK1RA1 said the question of nationality was secondary in this case. The Secretariat Committee was a technical Committee, whose members were selected on other grounds than that of nationality.
K. BUIS said it was likely that LI. Comert would not return to Geneva before ten days.
The SECT:UTARY-GSPIRAL said it was very important that the Secretariat Committee should begin work on the following Monday. He hoped If. Comert would be able to attend the first meeting. In case of necessity If. Comert might appoint a member of the Information Section as his substitute.
2) Departure of the Secretary-General for London.
The SI3C3MTARY-GIT1E5RAL informed the meeting that he was leaving the following week for London. He was ready
o
to hear the suggestions which, might he made with a view to his bringing up particular questions in the conversations he would Lave with the British representative on the Council
3) Conference on Bi-rport and Import Prohibitions and restrictions.
K. AT Hi CL explained that the Conference, whose object
ViRl
;o suppress by means of an international convention
certain pcst-war measures in the matter of customs, had resulted in a Convent ion which had already been signed by eighteen States« It provided for an early abolition of recent deformations of the customs system. apart from the technical value of the Convention, it was important to note that it had been possible to agree on an international Convention concerning measures which up to now had been considered as pertaining to the moat exclusive realm of national sovereignty.
The Convention provided for certain reservations.
It was to be noted that for these reservations a formula had been found which constituted a very interesting progress. The maintenance of certain prohibitions had been consented to various States for a certain time. Reservations had therefore been made on the basis of an agreement, and States were not at liberty to issue new prohibitions.
The Conference was to meet again next year, when it
would	C_ti Cm-"	0 on the	res	ervations to be agreed upon and the
entry	into	force of	the	Convention.

members of the Conference wished XI. Colijn to ¿'reside ever
the next Conference. II. Coli,in had been an admirable President.
In answer tc a cue at ion put by M. be Madariaga the SjCIGTARY-jEMEHAJi explained, that the architect, or architects, who would he chosen to cor struct the new building, would, have also to construct a League library, by utilising an important part of the gift of ^2,000,000 made for that purpose by hr, Rockfeller. The Assembly had voted a credit, with a view to setting up a special comi. ittee which would indicate what sum ought to be spent for a building and on what general lines the League library ought to be developed. The Committee would probably meet in February. The Secretary-General intended to ask H. Lufour-Feronce to deal with this question,
5}	Withdrawal of Office Circular regarding payment for
private local telephone cells.
The S3CRFTAHY-G3HER41 said he had decided to withdraw the recent circular on this question. Payment for all private telephone calls was provided for fey an article of the financial regulations; but he thought he could point out to the Supervisory Commission the difficulties which had arisen in connection with this question, and also the fact that members of the Secretariat were not reimbursed for official calls from their private houses. It might be assumed that these official calls compensated private calls from the Secretariat.
It was of course understood that; non-lccal private calls from the Secretariat would have to be paid for, as they had been in the past.

Activities of lea&ae Repräsentatives in Foreign Countries«
Ihe SBCEBIaKY'-OSETSEaL, referring to Directors* Meeting paper 12, thought it would he a&visabla in all future contracts of in&iii&uals serving under the league to insert a general clause to the effect that such individuale undertook not to engage in any commercial activities in the country to which they were »ante ‘»uch a douse would not offend anyone. If a proper fornnla ecu Id he found, it wgu Id he advisable to write to the Director ©f the International labour Office and tall him that the question had been
2 -
considered and that it was thought that the insertion of such a clausa wculd be a wise procaution»
Ua CO XS/Ji agro od wi th the Sc cr at ory-<Sanaral*
Li» SUCmiDBA eg rood ao to the advisability of the proposal, urovidod that it v;as under s tood that it should ba applied as a general rule. Agents of the league could bo considered ao being international officials in the sense of article 2 of the Statute for the Per senna 1 of the Secretariate but there might ba special cases to which the general rule would not apply.
Mr. F32ZIE, while agreeing that such a clause was most desirable in theory, feared the question might be rathar complicated in practice. He felt special anxiety as to the mechanism; who was to decide as to the insertion of the clausa?
The SSCB3TARY~GrE13EBAl thought the question of the mechanise did not arise in nracticc; it was enough to havo & formula»
M. EAA.8 pointed cut that the question concerned not aily the persons appointed by the league, but also their assistants, appointed by those persons themselves.
M. COHBAU said it was necessary to distinguish in the personnel appointed by the egents of the league between the international and tho local personnel*
The 33GH3TABY-G-EH5B X thought that the clausa should be inserted in the can tracts cf the international officials» xt would be for the league agent to see that hie local staff did not engage in business incompatible with their duties.
~s~
M. CGMSRI thought the clause should not ha drafted in too prsaisa a Danner, hut that it should he maoLo to cover the greatest number of possibilities*
M. HMS thought the clause would perhaps he still more useful in the case ©f the assistants than in the case of the persons appointed hj the league.
The SEKSIETARY-GEiFEEtAX thought that the fact that the contract drawn up for the league agent would contain a clause ©e. the incompatitibility of hia duties with work of a certain kind would induce him to exercise particular ear© in the selection of hie local assistants.
The See rat ary-Gone ral asked Mr. McKinnon Wood to prepare a general formula, and send it round.
Enquiry by Dr. Iledarbragt on tbs quastiofc of Publications *
Marquis P1IJIDCCI inferred the meeting that Dr. Nederhra^t was earning to Geneva in a few days to enquire,, on behalf of the Supervisory Commission, into the question of publications. He asked the Directors and Chiefs of Section concerned to help Dr. Nederbragt as far as possible .
The SECRETARY^ EN3RA1 thought the best procedure would be for Dt. ITederbragt to get in touch first with the Chairman of the Publications Committee, M. Avanol.
Mr. JACKIHT said there was the likelihood of a tendency of the Supervisory Commission te control publications through the budget. It might be wall if Directors should see Dr* Hederbragt themselves and not la&va it to subordinates.
M. ERIIS thought it would be useful if the Sections were informed of the work of the Publications Committee»
The SECRETARY —ISIîSiEüL said M. Avsnol night have a
meeting with the Dir a g tors to that effect.
3.	'-Travailing expenses for members of League committees»
M» HAAS wondered whether it would "be possible to raise v;ith Dr* ÎTederbragt tho question of travailing expenses for members of committees«, Sba new barême was indefensible from the point of view of communie ations *
Th3 SECRETARY-G-M3RAL sard that if the new barême had hoan adopted under the misapprehension that it was mere correct than the previous ors , it was quite possible to amend it. He asked M, Haas to submit a memorandum on the question to Marquis Paulucci*
4.	Meeting of the International Commission on Aerial Navigation.
M. HAAS said he had had the opportunity of attending the meeting of this Commission in Rome -, Ha had been impressed by the effectiveness of this body, whose powers were extensive-The States represented thereon were desirous of obtaining the cooperation of the greatest number of States. Denmark and Sweden had adhered, and the Netherlands were likely to do so. He felt that there would be a distinct advantage in retaining and perfecting the existing organisation, which there could be no question to suppress. Progress however must be made in the direction of making the Commis ai on more comparable with a League organisation and no difficulty was to be foreseen in this respect. The Commission would hold its next session at Geneva, which pmoved that it did not forget that it had been placed under the direction of the League, M. Haas1 impressions were somewhat different iron those which existed at the time when M. de Madariaga had first raised the question*

5.	Lea&ug Finances.
Mr* JACKLIN said he hoped the present financial year would close wLth a cash surplus cf one million francs, if States effected their payments as they had done during, the previous years»
6.	Private Manufacture of Munitions .
M. MAJEHTIBT said it resulted fran & letter which had bean received from a Czechoslovak firm that there was a mevoment towards a limitation of the output of munitions which would
f
result from a contemplated agreement batwaen private firms*
7.	Intellectual Cooperation»
M. OTFOUR-FKEONCE said he had bean informed that the French Covenamant intended to raise their annual subscription to the Paris Institute to 3 million French francs. No difficulty was to be expected in the Chamber, but there might he a slight difficulty in the Senate.
In London, M. Lufour-F^ronce had the impression that the British Government would fern a national committee as a correep ©lading body to the Paris Institute,

1.	Activité des Représentants de la Société des Rations en pays étrangers.
LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL pense que la formule proposée par Ir. McKinnon ïïood (Directors’Leeting Faper 13) est excellente. Eli a un caractère très général et peut être insérée aussi bien dans les contrats des représentants de la Société des îîaticns que dans
ceux de leurs subordonnés
- 2 -
Sir ARTHUR SALTER fait remarquer que c'est eu pensant spécialement aux subordonnés que la question de l'insertion d'une formule de ce genre a été posée. Il n'y a pas eu de Haut—Cor.missaire qui ait été accusé de transactions illégitimes *
LS SECRETAIRE GENERAL est d'accord. Il prie i’r. HcLinnon flood de préparer un projet de lettre au Directeur du -aireau international du Travail indiquant que l’on pense au Secrétariat que la formule conviendrait aussi cour les subordonnés des Commissaires.
Sur la proposition de LH BOILIET, la question de la traduction française de la formule de Lr. KcKimion Y’ood est renvoyée à la section juridique.*)
2.	nouvelle répartition des locaux entre les Sections,
Le r&EQUIS PAüLUCCI indique qu'il a reçu des demandes de chambres de plusieurs Sections: Section juridique 2; Information 4; section économique 4; le Sureau de 1' nérique latine demande deux chambres plus grandes. Dans le nouveau bâtiment, 25 bureaux sont ¿isponibles. La question est de savoir quelle Section quittera l'Hôtel national pour occuper les bureaux disponibles de la nouvelle maison et permettra ainsi de satisfaire aux demandes qui ont été formulées.
M. DUFOUR-FERONCE indique que la Section des Bureaux internationaux aura, l'an prochain, un nouveau membre et a, par conséquent besoin d'une chambre supplémentaire.
*) La Section juridique a établi le texte suivant:
"Le Commissaire (ou Honsieur H .....) n'occupera aucun poste et s'abstiendra de toute transaction ou entreprise qui pourraient être incompatibles avec les foliotions que lui confère la présente nomination".

3
Le Dr RAJ'CHLIAN a également besoin d’une autre chambre.
LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL dit qu’il ne peut s’agir, aujourd'hui, que de procéder à un examen préliminaire de la question et d'entendre les points de vue des différents Directeurs, il s'agit de trouver 14 chambres dans l’Hôtel National. Four cela il est nécessaire qu'une Section, nu peut-être deux, occupant ces 14 chambres eu davantage, proposent d’aller au nouveau bâtiment. Si aucune ne fait de proposition dans ce sens, le Secrétaire général devra prendre la décision qu’il juge la meilleure, en tenant compte des considérations qui seront formulées.
(Les Directeurs ou représentants des diverses Sections présents à la séance exposent ensuite leur point de vue).
3,	The Question of a possible reduction La the number of Council Sessions.
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Council had decided to hold two sessions before the next Assembly, and that the question of a possible induction in thqhumber of its meetings would be either definitely put on the agenda of the Assembly or discussed during the Assembly. He would have to prepare a report on the procedure resulting from the new composition of the Council. It might be possible to explain that the present number of four sessions a year could be maintained by holding two sessions during the Assembly - one before and the other after the elections for the Council - one session towards the end of January and another probably in May.
The question of the presidency of the Council had been raised, it was thought that there was inconvenience in having only a president, and no other officers.
The Secretary-General said that it might be pointed out that if the acting president was not available the Secretary-General would consult the previous one.
4
It had also been observed that under the present spave cf fourteen members, the presidency would not pass round to all non-permanent members of the Council, and especially so if the number of annual meetings was reduced. It had been proposed to give satisfaction to non-permanent members by creating a vicepresidency .
' e.rquis PAULUCCI observed that it had been proposed that when the president was a non—permanent member the vice-president would be a non-permanent member, and vice versa.
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL did not think that the assembly would approve of any distinction between permanent and non—permanent members. Moreover, he did not think that it was advisable to have a kind of bureau of the Council.
K. de MADARIAGA said that he saw only one instance when the president of the Council might not be available. It was in relation with Article 11. when the president might be a representative of one of the countries concerned, or the representative cf too friendly a country,
TEE SECRETARY-GENERAL pointed out that it might also happen that the representative of a distent state should return to his country and want the vice-president to replace him. In connection with Article 11 he pointed out that it was for the Secretary-General to convoke the council.
hr. COLBAN did not like the idea of having a vice-president. It might happen that a new president might say that he would consult the vice-president, who might be a very influential person.
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL said that in his report he would propose that if a vice-president was appointed the latter would only act if the president resigned.
— R
V---
: 'r. SUGII1URA said that what was necessary was to strengthen thepresidency of the Council. He pointed out that in the Polish—ithuanian question not only the president, but the rapporteur had been appointed to cooperate with the Secretary-General after the Session.
Dr. RAJCHIIAN said that a r.ember of the Council would not appreciate a Vice-Presidency if a vice-president had no powers except in. the case of resignation of the president. If a vice-president 7/as appointed there was a danger that it might lead to the constitution of a bureau.

Directors1 Meeting paper 11° 1.
DOTE BY TEE SECRETARY GENERAL.
The attached letter dated 3rd February 1927, from the Union of the Socialist Soviet republics raises the question, which I should like discussed at the Directors1 Meeting, of the action which in future should be taken by the Council in convoking Conferences to which the Government of the U,SaSaRa would normally be invited.
The suggestion which has been put forward, and which might be used by the meeting as a basis for discussion, is that in future the Secretary-General should be instructed to send to the Soviet Government for its information a copy of the letter of invitation sent to other Governments, with a note to the effect that a formal invitation would be addressed to the Soviet Government if it so desired.

monsieur le Secrétaire général,
Le Gouvernement de l'Union des Républiques Soviétistes Socialistes vient de recevoir la Note de M.-'A'v e n c 1 en date du 18 janvier relative à la convocation à Genève d'une Conférence en vue de la formation d'une Union Internationale de Secours.
Le Gouvernement de l'Union des R.S.3.'a eu à maintes reprises l'occasion de communiquer au:c organes de la Société des Nations que toute invitation de participer à des réunions convoquées sur le territoire suisse était considérée par lui comme nulle et non avenue.
Nonobstant ces communications, de pareilles invitations continuant comme dans le cas présent à parvenir à mon Gouvernement, je me vois obligé de Vous restituer sous ce pli la Note originale du 18 Janvier, mon Gouvernement refusant catégoriquement de se considérer comme invité à des réunions indiquant des villes suisses comme lieu de réunion.
Veuillez agréer, ¿.¡onsieur le Secrétaire général, les assurances de ma haute considération.

Directors1 Meeting Paper 3.
rarr, by tsp SfCRSPAPY-cjiraiJih.
Poll mving the discussion at the Directors1 meeting of 16th -«arch cn the programme for the opening of the Assembly set forth in Confidential Circular 1, 1627, I should like the attached revised programme to he discussed at a future meeting.
It will he noted that, according to the revised programme, the Assembly would rise on the first morning immediately after the election of the President, and would meet again at 4 p.m. I am inclined to think tliat it would he an improvement if, in future, the proposals of the President regarding the adoption ef the agenda, etc., were embodied in a document which would be prepared before the session, and of which the incoming President would authorise the distribution immediately after his election. Delegates would thus be in a position to know these proposals when the President reads them out from the Chair at the afternoon meeting

Mr. JACKLHT said he wished to inform the
meeting, at the Secretary-General's request that the Swedish Government, having received from the League the sum of Gold Francs 35397 87/100 as a refund of a proportion of the building fund to which it had contributed, had stated that it did not desire to accept the refund, but preferred to place the money at the disposal of the League. The Council would be informed of the position and would doubtless accept the money placed at its disposal by the Swedish Government.
believed the best course would be to place this sum in a special emergency fund.

Los Sections ne doivent pas compter sur le service des précis-writers pour l'établissement d'aucun procès-verbal des séances des Commission de la Société autres que les Commissions .de l'Assemblée qui pourraient être tenues pendant la durée de celle-ci; elles auront à assumer elles-mêmes la rédaction des procès-verbaux de ces séances.
li, Huston, les Secrétaires des Commissions, les chefs des Services administratifs régleront ensemble toute question de matériel ou de personnel qui pourrait se poser.
Rien ne sera changé aux diverses publications éditées par le Secrétariat pendant l'Assemblée (Journal de l'Assemblée comprenant des résumés très brefs établis par le Secrétariat sans être soumis aux Délégués ayant pris part aux débats, et n’ayant aucun caractère officiel. Comptes-raniLuE in-extenso des séances plénières), les procès verbaux des Commissions seront publiés seulement après l'Assemblée.
Eour éviter certaines observations sur les procès-verbaux des Commissions, peut-être, conviendrait-il de rappeler les conditions dans lesquelles le texte définitif de ces procès-verbaux sera établi. A cet effet, le Secrétaire général pourrait, comme l'année dernière, adresser un6 note au Bureau de l'Assemblée. Après examen par le Bureau, cette note serait transmise par lui aux présidents des Commissions, qui en donneraient lecture à chaque Commission.
(Le texte de la note adressée l'année dernière aux présidents des Commissions se trouve dans le Journal de l'Assemblée, supplément spécial N° 28, pages 9 et 10.).

V	-Les Secrétaires aes Commissions devront indiquer clairement, aussitôt que possible aux Commissions, les documents qui sont mis à leur disposition et qui contiennent des éléments d'information sur les questions qui leur sont soumises, Il est désirable que la marche du travail des Commissions et l'ordre dans lequel les questions diverses seront abordées, soient réglés, autant que possible, à l’avance..
Afin d'assurer l'unité du travail entre les différentes Commissions, une réunion des Secrétaires des Commissions aura lieu sur convocation dans le bureau du Secrétaire général adjoint avant la sésnce de l'Assemblée, de façon que le Secrétaire général puisse être tenu quotidiennement au courant du progrès de3 discussions et régler en conséquence l'ordre ^u jour des séances de l'Assemblée,
Pour faciliter la préparation de l'ordre du jour des séances plénières, les secrétaires des commissions seront invités en outre d'informer par des notes quotidiennes le Secrétariat de la Présidence de l'état de leurs travaux.
Il y aurait avanta&c à ce que les rapporteurs chargés de présenter à 1'assemblée les résolutions adoptées par les Commissions fussent désignés aussitôt que possible. Toutefois, ceci ne sera certainement pas réalisable dans tous les cas, la plupart des Commissions préférant choisir pour les représenter devant l'Assembléo un de leurs membres dont les vues correspondent manifestement à celles de la majorité,

THE SECRETAEY--GENEEAL.
As you are aware there have been complaints, and weELfouncied complaints, on all hands about the lack of discipline in the Assembly. It has improved somewhat, but it is still bad. It is not merely a question of stopping the talking but also of stopping the constant movement that goes on. I give below a number of regulations which I suggest it might be well to ask the Pureau of the Assembly to circulate as regulations laid down by themselves.
It will, I believe, help considerably^ maintaining discipline. At the same time it is especially necessary that the President, whoever he may be, should take himself a very strong and forceful attitude as otherwise it becomes extremely difficult to carry out the regulations.
The regulations which I propose are as follows:
(1)	The front entrance of the Assembly Hall leading directly from the lobby of the Hotel Victoria is reserved exclusively for delegates and substitute delegates, and the officers in charge of this door have been given instructions to allow no one else to pass through the door. Immediately at the side of this door a passage way has been arranged leading to an entrance in the rear of the Hall.
This passage way is exclusively reserved for secretaries of delegation experts, members of the secretariat etc. and should be utilised by them in entering or leaving the ..ssenbly Hall.
(2)	The floor of the Hall itself will be reserved entirely for delegates and substitute delegates, jo experts, advisers, secretaries cr ¡members of the secretariat, no member of the general public nor of the families of the above-mentioned persons will be allowed on this
9
floor. If a delegate desires to advisers, it is requested that
speak to one he leave the
of his secretaries or floor of the Hall
itself.
(3) Immediately behind the desks of of tne ss&fiibly floor has been reserved 3 experts and members of the Secretariat.
xclus
delegates ively for
a portion secretaries,
^,4; enters of the general public and of the families of •rs of the delegations should sit in the diplomatic or public
	(5) entrance to	th

floor of the Assembly Hall will be by card ïtrictly personal, and if a card is presented > person to v/hom it is issued the huissiers have been given instructions to refuse admittance and to take up the card.
(6)	..o applause will be allowed in the galleries reserved for the press and the general public.
(7)	It is requested that in so far as possible officials should not enter or leave the floor of the Assembly Hall during the
time when a speech is being made.
rig to converse together should make use of
(8)	Officials d siri the lobbies, and conversations in the Assembly Hall itself should be reduced to the absolute minimum.

I should like to discuss at a Directors' Heating the foil owing point in connexion with the Special Committee which is to he sot up by the Preparatory Committee to consider ¿arbitration and Security.
As the Preparatory Committee work is considerably advanced, there will be now a somewhat clear distinction between the sphere of actual technical disarmament work and that of Arbitration and Security. Phis being so, I am inclined to think that it is no longer essential that the Disarmament Section should be altogether responsible for the activities which the Special Committee will cover.
1 would suggest, therefore, that Monsieur Suginura, if hi wore willing to do so, might become the Secretary of the new Committee, the work being performed primarily by the Political Section in collaboration with the legal and Disarmament sections.

Directors’ nesting Paper 11.
Geneva, October 4th. 1927.
RECORD OF I E TERVI ¿7/;
Monsieur VAZ DE HELLO, the Brazilian Chargé d'affaires, cam to S99 me this afternoon. He said that he had come to enquire, by-instructions of his Government, whether the Brazilian contribution was payable for the whole of the year 1928, or only up to the date when the notice of withdrawal took effect.
I replied that, in my view, it was quite clear that the payment was only due as long as Brazil was a Member of the League, and therefore would cease on the day when the notice of withdrawal became effective. There were, however, other points to be considered;
(1)	YThether Brazil would still wish to contribute towards the upkeep of the International Court of Justice;
(2)	Whether she would wish to remain a member of the Labour Organisation, and therefore contribute towards the exponses of the International Labour Office.
Apart from these two autonomous organizations of the -league there are also the Technical Organizations to be considered. The Assembly, some years ago, passed a resolution by which a state not a member of the League could be a member of the Technical Organizations I did not know what 3razil’s wishes in this respect would be.
The Chargé ¿'Affaires replied that he could not give me information on any of the points which I had raised. All he wanted to be able to do was to telegraph to his Government some figure, s<i that that amount might be inserted in the Budget for 1928, which was now being prepared.
K
.B. Directors' Meeting Paper 9 (Special Committee to consider Arbitration and Security, dated September 25th. 1927) should be considered as Directors' Meeting Paper 10.
2
I said to him that I would endeavour to let him have a memorandum setting out the exact amounts which would he involved for each particular purpose, as regards the general contribution, and those of the Court and International Labour Office, the matter is quite simple; but it is otherwise when we come to the Technical Organisations, because no formal definition exists as to which organizations should be considered technical or not. It is clear that the Health, Transit and Financial organizations are included in the term "Technical Organizations".
I think: that the same may he true as regards the item, "Suppression of Traffic in Women and Protection of Children", but I have considerable doubt on the point. Then come other items about which I am even more doubtful, viz,, Intellectual Co-operation, Supervision of the Opium Traffic, and the Committee on the Prcgx-essive Codification of International law. The third class, which I think should be ruled out, are «.(ministrative Commissions and liinorities questions, Mandates and the deduction of Armaments. Perhaps it would be possible to allow a non-Member State a choice as to waich if any of these Technical Organizations she would wish to contribute, at any rate as regards the 2nd category. The point, however, is of considerable difficulty, and requires careful study., I therefore think that the best practical dan of dealing with the Brazilian case for the moment would be simply to inform the Chargé d'affaires that, as regards the Technical Organizations,
the contribution would not exceed .........,promising to
send him a further detailed memorandum after the necessary study has been completed.
Meanwhile, I should he glad if we could have a preliminary discussion cf the question at the Directors Meeting on Wednesday.

ACTIVITIES OF LEAGUE REPRESENTAT!Oil II< FOREIGN <CUITTRIE3.
Lego by Hr* Abraham.
ffhe Secretary-General.
(Through it* Sugimura.)
At various times in the last few years it has been stated
that individuals representing or in some way connected with the League, in various foreign countries, have engaged in operations of profit, in addition to the activities fob which they had been appointed. Some of the agents of the High Commissioner for Refugees have been, justly or unjustly, inculpated; and I have recently heard of a more serious case - if it is true.
there appeared the following clause
" Le Conseiller financier s’engage à ne pas s’occuper, sauf avec l'assentiment du Gouvernement albanais, d’autres affaires que de celles intéressant le Gouvernement albanais pendant la durée de son contrat. Il s’engage à ne pas devenir actionnaire de compagnies commerciales situées en Albanie’’,
•r letters of appointment of individuals serving under the League or as agents of mandatories of the League to insert a clause to the effect that the individual undertakes during the period of his service not to engage in any commercial activities in the country in which ho is performing official functions in connection with the League. If such a clause were automatically put in all contracts it could not be considered invidious by anybody. The actual phrasing of it could be undertaken by the Legal Section.
In the contract of Hr. Hunger, Financial Adviser to Albania,
I wonder whether it would be possible in all future contracts
2
If this idea were entertained it right be wise to inform the director of the International Labour Office of what was proposed
in case he should	see fit to establish the same rule*

QUESTION OP TEm PARTICIPATION Cx TE¿ U.R.S.3. ID THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE 01 THu DISARMAMENT OOilPERERO^ ADD IiJ THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE CM ARBITRATION AHD SECURITY.
I.	Rote by the Secretary-General.
I am quite ready for the question of the participation of the TJ.R.3.3. in the special committee on Atritration and Security to be d iscujr.se d at a Directors' Meeting. I shall reserve my considered opinion till then.
But it seems to me that, at first sight, if the U.R.S.3. really wish to co-operate their presence is desirable first of all at the Preparatory Committee and then at the Security Committee. If, however, their wish is to hinder and throw difficulties in the way of the work, then their absence is preferable to their presence.
It must he remembered that Russia was originally invited to attend the Preparatory Committee, and in my view that invitation is still open. If something is required to remind the Russians of the original invitation, I do not see why we should not send for information to the U.R.S.,3. copies of th; Assembly resolutions about Security, with a reference to the original invitation to attend the Preparatory Committee.
This would allow the U.R.S.S. tc send representatives to the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee, should they , wish to do so, while, if they do not sc desire, they need pay no attention to our letter.

II. Note by -fri, von Regthe-Fink.
M. Sugimura.
Au cours de la dernière réunion de notre Section, vous aviez posé la question de la participation de l’Union des Républiques Socialistes et Soviétiques aux travaux du Comité d’arbitrage et d. sécurité visé dans la Résolution V prise par l'Assemblée le 26 septembre 1927 et dans la résolution prise par le Conseil en date du 27 septembre 1927,
Il me semble utile de vous fournir à ce sujet les éléments d'appréciation suivants:
1)	La résolution de l'Assemblée et celle du Conseil portent que le Comité d’arbitrage et de sécurité sera composé des représentants de tous les Etats qui siègent à la Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du .Désarmement et sont membres de la Société des Nations, les autres Etats représentés à la Commission étant invités à en faire partie s’ils le désirent.
J'appuie sur le mot "représentés". L’U.R.S.S* **) avait bien été invitée à siéger à la Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du Désarmement conformément à la résolution du Conseil en date du 12 décembre 1925*); mais elle n'a pas accepté cette invitâtion.*“*'
Je ne pense donc pas qu'elle puisse exprimer sans plus le désir de faire partie du Comité d’arbitrage et de sécurité.
2)	On est ainsi amené à examiner la question de la participation de l’U.R.S.S. à la Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du Désarmement.
*) Lettre du Président du Conseil du 12 décembre 1925.
**) Lettre de M. Tchitchérine m 16 janvier 1926.
_ 'Z
O
A l'époque où l'invitation à siéger à cette Commission a été adressée à l'U.R.S.S.. le conflit de cette-ci avec la Suisse, relativement à l'incident Vorcwsky, n'était pas encore réglé.
Comme dans d'autres cas, l'U.R.S.S., dans sa réponse, a motivé son refus par l'impossibilité où elle se trouvait, en conséquence, d'envoyer des représentants en Suisse, tout en marquant le désir qu'elle aurait de participer aux travaux de la Commission.
Malgré ce refus, le Conseil insista (lettre du Secrétaire général du 18 mars 1926); mais l'U.R.S.S. persista dans son attitude, en s'exprimant cette fois dans des termes peu obligeants pour la Société des Nations.*)
Les choses en sont restées là jusqu'à présent. Toutefois,
un évènement important est intervenu depuis lors. Le conflit entre
a
l'U.R.S.S. et la Suisse a été réglé. Cela/déterminê la Russie, comme vous le savez, à prendre part à la Conférence économique, bien quell eût refusé antérieurement d'y envoyer des délégués et que l'invitation n'eût pas été renouvelée. On a considéré, de part et d'autre, que l'invitation avait subsisté.
Si l'on estime que la situation se présente exactement de la meme façon, l'U.R.S.S. pourrait faire connaître à tout moment son intention de participer aux travaux de la Commission préparatoire et ’ûe s'y faire représenter.
Il y a tout de même une petite différence entre les deux cas; c'est que les travaux de la Conférence économique n'étaient pas encore commencés tandis que c'est la quatrième session de la Commission préparatoire qui va s'ouvrir au mois de novembre prochain. Jusqu'à présent, la date des sessions, qui sont convoquées par le Président de la Commission préparatoire, n'a naturellement pas été communiquée à l'U.R.S.S.
*) Lettre de Tchitchêrine du 7 avril 1926.

3)	?jur les travaux du Comité dArbitrage et de sécurité, la participation de 11 IJ.R.S.S, présenterait évidemment un grand intérêt » Comme M* Bénès l!a rappelé à la deuxième séance de la troisième Commission de 1'Assemblée, le Traité de Locarno assure, par son application, la sécurité dans une grande partie de l'Europe- tant à l'est qu’à l'ouest, et consolide sensiblement
la situation internationale dans son ensemble, Mais il n'existe rien d’analogue enire la Russie et ses voisins, excepté en ce qui concerne la Lithuanie et, jusqu'à un certain degré, la Lettonie.
Il sera difficile de faire oeuvre utile dans cette région en ce qui concerne l'action envisagée par la Société des dations en vue de provoquer, de généraliser et de coordonner les accords particuliers ou collectifs d'arbitrage et de sécurité, si l'U.R.S.S. ne participe pas aux travaux à entreprendre. Il est même à craindre que, au cas où l’U.R.S.S, ne serait pas représentée au Comité d’arbitrage et de sécurité, sa non-participation ne risque d'aggraver les rapports de celle-ci avec ses voisins.
4)	Quand les Russes sont venus pour la Conférence économique M. Boris Stein a, pour autant que je sache, manifesté un grand intérêt pour le Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du Désarmement. Il a eu des conversations avec M. de Madariaga et s'est "ait remettre les documents relatifs aux travaux de la Commission,
Depuis lors, les Russes ont également participé, bien que dans une mesure restreinte, à la Conférence internationale des Experts de Presse: mais ils ont refusé ensuite de venir à la Conférence générale du Transit et à la Conférence diplomatique relative aux restrictions et prohibitions à l’importation et à l'exportation, qui va se réunir prochainement-^

On sait quMI y a deux courants à l'os cou, l'un qui s'oppose à la participation à toute conférence internationale, l'autre qui y eut favorable, D'autre part, il no faut pas non plus perdre de vue la lutte qui existe actuellement entre l'opposition et Stalin, ni le fait que l'opposition essaie de s’emparer de tout prétexte pour faire campagne contre ce dernier oui, en conséquence, est contraint d'etre très prudent, XI se peut donc qu'avant le mois de décembre où le grand Congrès au Parti oolchéviste aura lieu en Russie, on n'ose prendre aucune décision.
De toute façon, il serait peut-être utile de poser à la prochaine réunion des Directeurs la question de la participation de l’UoRoS.S* au Comité d'arbitrage et de sécurité, et de connaître les idées de Sir Eric 'Drummond et de Iü0 de Madariaga à ce 3ujst. On pourra alors juger en plus grande connaissance de cause de la marche à suivre en la matière.

SENDING TO THE MLMBEPS OP THE LEAGUE O':1 CIRCULAR LETTEES 1 0 37 A "-DIN G~~0ZETA IN 1.! Z 00 MI E N DA T ION S 01' Till ASSEMBLY.
I . Secretary-General (from Mr, Wilson).
I am reluctant to bring before you again a question which you have twice recently decided, but perhaps you should see the attached note of Mr. Buxton to me. ^
As you know, I also think that it would be better not to send to the Members of the League Circular Letters forwarding resolutions of the Assembly which merely rec ;mmend that certain action should be taken and do not ask that the result of 3uch action be notified to the Secretariat.
It is , I think, now an established practice that, when the Assembly desires action to be taken by the Secretariat, such as the collection of information from Members of the League, it frames its resolutions as recommendations to the Council, to give the necessary instructions to the Secretariat, In due course, the Council acts on these recommendations, and the Secretary-General sends out the necessary Circular Letters.
It seems to be useful that, when a Government receives a letter signed by the Secretary-General, it should understand that it is something which normally calls for a considered reply. If, however, Governments receive, as they do under the present system, a very large number of letters
TT7
I think the Secretary-General 3'nould consider whether these letters are necessary ir. view of the fact that the resolutions were distributed to the Delegates at the Assembly and to the Governments subsequently in the Brown book of Assembly resolutions.
Mould it not be sufficient to send a letter to Non-Members only where these are involved-'.
feigned") !■. Buxton.
signed by the Secretary-General, most of which contains simply general recommendations of the Assembly which call for no reply, they may tend to pay less attention to those which do call for reply.
If it is thought desirable formally to draw attention to the resolutions adopted by the Assembly, it would of course be possible for the Secretary-General after each session to communicate one copy of the Brown Book with a signed letter to all the Members of the League. This copy would naturally be additional to the copies of the Brown Book and of the separate Assembly reports and resolutions distributed to Members.
nothing in this system, if adopted, need affect the freedom of the Secretary-General to communicate specially such resolutions of the Assembly as he may think fit fe.g. the Budget resolutions), even though the Council may have taken no action on them.
I do not know if you may think the point worth mentioning at a Directors Meeting.

II. Dote by the Secretary-General.
The suggestion is worth consideration.
How long does it take before the Brown Book is ready?^x^ Ve might perhaps enclose it in a letter calling special attention to those resolutions which have foiroed the subject of separate communications and to Assembly recommendations to the various

Govemments Members of the League,
But there are resolutions such as these by which the Assembly urges ratification of a Convention that it is desirable should be brought to the special attention of the Governments of States Members of the league, and it is to be remembered that the Assembly resolutions affect different Government Departments , which prefer to have separate copies of resolutions concerning them. It would be somewhat invidious to distinguish between this class of resolutions.
I think, therefore, we should continue the present practice this year, but Mr. Wilson's minute and my note thereon might be circulated to all Sections for consideration at a future Directors Meeting.

Supply of Confidential documents and minutes of Committees and Technical Organisations to Governments represented thereon.
1.	Résumé de la correspondance échangée entre la Délégation polonaise auprès de la Société des Hâtions et le Secrétariat.
Le 4 mai dernier, la Délégation polonaise pria Miss nocking de lui envoyer, en deux exemplaires, tous les documents et procès-verbaux des Comités consultatifs de la traite des femmes et des enfants et de la protection de l'enfance et de la jeunesse. La délégation ajoutait que tes comités étant des organes composés de représentants des Gouvernements, elle croyait que sa demande était entièrement conforme aux règles en vigueur.
Dame Rachel Crowdy, consultée sur cette requête, rappela que la Commission de l'epium, ou plutôt certains de ses Membres, avaient défendu énergiquement la thèse que les documents confidentiels de cette Commission ne devaient être communiqués qu'à ses Membres.
Sur les instructions du Secrétaire général, Miss Hocking envoya à la Délégation polonaise la réponse suivante:
"Le Gouvernement polonais étant représenté au sein des Comités de la Traite des femmes et des enfants et de la protection de l'enfance et de la jeunesse, des instructions ont été données au personnel du Service de la Distribution en vue d'assurer l'envoi à la Délégation polonaise de tous les documents et procès-verbaux qui n'ont pas un caractère confidentiel.
''En ce qui concerne les document s confidentiels, î'iss Hocking est chargée d’informer la délégation polonaise qu’il est plus conforme à laprocédure actuellement suivie que la responsabilité de la Communication de ces documents aux Gouvernements représentés aux Comités incombe aux délégués eux-mêmes qui reçoivent ces documents à titre de membres individuels des Comités".
Le 19 octobre 1927, la Délégation polonaise fit savoir conformément aux instructions du ministère des Affaire s Etrangères, qu’ lie ne pouvait partager l’avis du Secrétariat en ce qui concerne la procédure actuellement suivie pour la communication aux ouverne-rr.ents des documents confidentiels des Comités et des organisations techniques de la Société où ces Gouvernements se trouvent officiellement représentés,
La Délégation polonaise ajoutait:
"A l’avis du ouvernenent polonais, il n’est pas possible de faire uns discrimination entre la responsabilité de son représentant au sein d'un Comité ou autre organisation émanant
t celle de sa	représentation	diplo-
nte auprès de	la wcciété des	mat ions.
genre paraît	d'autant moins	justifiée
aux yeux du Gouvernement polonais qu’il incombe entre autres à la Délégation polonaise permanente à Genève de collaborer intimement avec tous les représentants et experts du Gouvernement polonais dans les diverses organisations de la Société des Estions et, partant, de rester an contact avec eux à leur retour à Varsovie.
"Dans ces conditions, le uélêgation polonaise se permet de réitérer à Monsieur le Secrétaire général sa demande de bien
3
vouloir donner les instructions nécessaires en vue d'assurer à la Délégation un service régulier et complet de tous les documents y compris les procès-verbaux de caractère public ou confidentiel des organisations, commissions ou comités au sein desquels le 'ouvernement polonais se trouve représenté.
"D'autre part, la Délégation polonaise a êtc chargée de réserver le point de vue de son Gouvernement en ce qui concerne les modalités de communication aux Gouvernements des documents concernant les organisations de la Société des Dations, composées d’experts nommés à titre personnel".
. Note by the Serretary-General
Although, personally, I agree with the contention of the olish Government that a Government is entitled to receive all ocuments emanating from a Committee on which it is officially epresented, in view of the difficulties we have experienced in the ast I should be inclined to reply that, while I arc of course anxious -o meet the views of the Polish Government in every way possible, I 'eel that, in view of the artitude taken in the past by certain members of Committees composed of Government representatives, difficulties tfouid be created, unless there is a formal Council decision in the sense desired by the Polish Government. If, therefore, the Polisn Government considers that the practical arrangement which I suggested is not acceptable, perhaps it would see fit to bring the question before the Council.
As to the point raised in that last paragraph of the to1ish note, I believe the insistence on it would simply lead to the experts raving little else than unofficial meetings; but we need not at
present consider it
The matter concerns however numerous Sections of the Secretariat, it would therefore be well that it should be
discuss	ed	at	a Directors'	I Meeting.	If the	Directors' m
thinks	as	it	may will do,	that my	suggested	reply to th
Governm	ent	places an init		iative on	that Gov	eminent wh ic
be taken by the Secretariat, I should be quite willing to tell the Polish Government that I would myself bring the matter before the Council, so that a decision binding on the various Committees may be taken.

Directors’Meeting Paper 12, October 4, 1917*
At the Directors’meeting at which the above paper was considered, I vas ashed to attempt to draft a clause which could be inserted in the terns of appointment of Jo:nmis si oners t etc«, appointed by the League for the purpose of preventing them from engaging in transactions incompatible with their official situation* It was, I think, agreed that the clause was not to attempt to define and prohibit specific kinds of transactions but was to be a general formula laying down a principle so as merely to give a hint to the persons concerned as to the behaviour expected of them and to provide a basis for action in the event of any real scandal, without containing anything which might suggest that wa thought they would be likely to yield to temptation in the absence of a prohibition, or setting up any machinery to decide in detail what would or would not be proper*
It is rather difficult to meet these requirements. The best proposal I can make is the following :
"The (Commissioner, etc«, etc*,... Monsieur X) may not accupy any post or engage in any transaction or business which might be incompatible with the functions which he is hereby appointed to exercise*"
I
2
lx you think this formula complete enough and a suitable basis for discussion, perhaps it might be circulated to the Directors1 meeting. It is, of course, easy to amplify it by, for example, adding that the clause refers more particularly to financial or commercial transactions in the country in which the Commissioner exercises his functions, or with persons or associations in that country» On the whole, I think it is best to be quite vague»

The French translation of my formula would be as follows :

et sTabstiendra de toute entreprise, susceptibles de se trouver incompatibles avec le3 fonctions que lui confèrent les présentes."

As a result of certain proposals made, particularly by Ilajor Burton, as to the procedure during the first two days of the Assembly, I ashed Ur. Walters, K. Bonnet, II. Teixidor,
II. de Ilontenach and a representative of the Information Section to consider the subject and draw up proposals which I could placv_ before a Directors 1 Ileeting.
I herewith attach a note from Hi'. 'Walters containing the proposals made by the above Committee.

Secretary-General.
The Committee appointed in your Ilinute of 14th October net this morning at 11 a.n. in Hr. Teinidor's room.
After considering the various proposals which have been made, the Committee decided to recommend that the procedure set forth in the Annem should be followed at the ne;:t session of the Assembly.
The Committee was of opinion that that procedure might need to bo changed in certain respects according to the circumstances. In particular, it might be thought preferable - though the Committee was not unanimous on the point - that the President of the Council should nahe the speech which he now names at the opening of the first meeting at the opening of the debate on the vorh of the Council (presumably on the second morning of the assembly). His opening speech on the first morning would then be of brief and formal mind.

Confidential Circular 4.1927,
MOTE BY TEE SECRET^Y-GEHEBi.L,
I should like the following question to "be discussed at an early Directors’ Meeting as I may ho eonsulted upon it in the near future.
To what oxtent is it right for members of the Counoil to give to their rospeotive parliaments or to the Dress information oonoerning Counoil meetings which has not been published in the Minutes and Reports of the Council or the Secretariat1s Press ocmmuniques?
Naturally this is, striotly speaking, a question for the Counoil itself to answer, and in any case I doubt if any fully satisfactory general answer oould be given to it. However, the viow which I would advonco as a basis for discussion by the meeting is that, generally, a member of the Council is entitled, should he find it really dosirebla, to explain publicly the line be himself taok at e secret or private meeting of the Council, and also to state the general sense of the Council's final decision and the reasons leading to it; but that he is not entitled to inform the public of the opinions of his individual oolleagues. It is, of course, desirable that no member of the Counoil should give such information without considering how the general interest of the League would bo affected by his action.

NOTE BY THE SECEET ARY-GENERAL.
(l) Tho small Committee which it was decided at the last Directors1 Meeting to sot up with regard to Rapporteurs1 Roports and oortain questions affecting Counoil organisation generally has now reported. The Committee states that there is usually a period about the middle of the Council session when subjects ready for discussion are hard to find. The absolutely non-oontroversial questions are polished off the first day, committees have not reported and the rapporteurs on controversial questions are shy of producing reports that may meet with opposition. The result is that reports are often circulated so late that Members complain of insufficient time to read thorn.
To counteract this, it is suggested that in every possiblo case Sections should send to rapporteurs a draft report at least three weeks before the Council, requesting that the report may be returned in time for circulation at least ten days before the Council meets.
On considering the agenda, there is no reason why the recommendations of the Committee should not be oomplied with in the case of Questions (la) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6b) (10)
(11) (21) (22) and (23). I hope, too, that questions (6a) and (26) could havo roports circulated at least a week beforehand.
Quostions (9) and (20) are rather exceptional, but here again I hope every endeavour will be made to send out at least provisional reports.
This wculd leave over for the end of tho session those questions which are tho result of Ccmmitteos which meet only just before end during tho Council, end also questions on which one or moro Members of the Counoil ere particularly interested, with whom the Rapporteur naturally would vtish to discuss his report. In any case it is most important that every effort should be mode to circulate ell such reports at least 24 hours before they ere dealt with by the Council.
(2) If, as sooms possible, the Council only meets once a day in the aftornoon, I would try to read cut at tho end of each meoting the agenda for the following day.
Members of the Council would bo thus informed and the agenda would bo circulated as soon es possible after the meoting.
For this purpose, it would be necessary for Major Suxton to prepare a document containing the proposals for the agenda for the next day.

Memorandum by Mr, Sweetser
SECHE lARY-GEi: SEAL
The American Chargé at Berne telephoned privately this morning to confirm the news that on February 5,
President Coolidge sent a messa-e to Congress recommending American participation in the Economic Conference and the necessary appropriation for 15,DOO dollars therefor.
The message, as quoted, gave a good statement of the purpose sf the Conference, stressing not only the importance of the economic reconstruction of the world hut also America’s part and interest therein. It also called attention ;r American participation in the Arms Conference and concluded that it would result not in specific obligations to the United btates but rather in a world-wide economic programme .
I think we are safe in taking it for granted that this recommendation will be accepted, and that the most important question remaining in connection therewith is the composition'of the American Delegation.

It will be remembered that as a result of the Directors1 meeting of November 25th 1926 decisions were taken to ensure that circular letters to the Members of the League should refrain from asking for a reply by a date which would render impossible their proper consideration bj- distant Members cf the League.	My attention has been called since then to
the question of the notification to such Members of items on the agenda of the Council of interest to them.
I hate come to the conclusion that such notification, except where it concerns Members which have in Europe representatives formally accredited to the League of Nations, should be made by cable. I should be grateful, therefore, if eaafc Section when invited to comment on the list of States not represented on the Council to be invited to a session of the Council, would draw the attention of the Secret ary ^General's office to any State to which notice of items of the agenda concerning that Section should he sent by cable.

This is an exceptionally interesting report, ana 1 wish, in the first instance, to express my appreciation of the ver: intense and successful work which Monsieur Yuruleaki has undertaken in Japan. It has obviously implied considerable sacrifice on his part, and I an very grateful to hire for it. Perhaps the report should go in the first instance to Monsieur Suginura for any remarks which he may care to make, and after that, if he agrees, I think that it would certainly be worth while to have it xoneoed and circulated to Under
Secretaries General and Directors.
I am much struck by the importance and value of the work done by the Japanese Association for' the Icamae of nations and I should like to do all we can to help forward their effort
J
llonoieur Ccraert should consider the various suggestions which affect the Information Section. It se ms to me to be desirable that arrangements should be made by which Llonsieur _oki should visit the Assembly once in two years. A special budgetary provision tc this effect might be inserted
when the time comes.
The report shews that the question of Intellectual C o-o'p ration is of special interest to Japan. Monsieur DufourTs attention should be particularly drawn to this.
Pages 9, 10 and 11 of the report are of particular interest firom a general league point of view. If I were to
reply to	the criticism that acme	day when	+■ V, n Kilo	Turo peen	s ta te s

Rapport sur mon séjour au Japon
( Décembre 1026 - Janvier 1927).
I.- Itinéraire.
J’ai quitté Genève le soir du 20 octobre pour Marseille, en vue de m'y embarquer le 22 octobre, à bord du SS, "Général Metzinger ”, (Messageries Maritimes), à destination du Jam. J’ai débarqué à Yokohama le 5 décembre et suis arrivé à Tokio le meme jour. Je suis resté à Tokio jusqu’à la fin de janvier de cette année peur m’occuper d’un certain nombre d'affaires concernant la Société des Nations; je n’ai donc pu quitter la capitale et il m’a failli renoncer à rentrer dans mon pays natal.
J'ai quitté Tokio le 31 janvier au soir et j'ai passé un jour à Osaka et un jour à Eobé, avant le départ du Paquebot ’’Hakozaki Ma ru” (N.Y.K.) à bord duquel j’ai regagné l’Europe.
II.- Caractère et programme de mon séjour.
Bien que mon séjour au Japon ait eu surtout un caractère privé, j'ai consacré, avec olaisir, une grande partie de mon temps à des travaux ne liaison entre Tokio et Genève, renforçant les contacts directs avec quelques personnalités éminentes qui exercent, d'une manière ou d’une autre, une grande influence sur l’attitude du Ja'on à la Société des Nations et développant les moyens de faire connaître au Japon l’existence et les buts de la Société.

très courte, je me suis efforcé surtout 4e voir avec lesquels ¿'entretiens, cour des misons of:
Haies ou privées, des relations assez intimes. J'ai eu notamment des entretiens avec des personnes appartenant au Gouvernement, au Sénat, à ]a Chambre des Dé.mtés, au Conseil privé, aux Etats-Majors militaires et navals, aux Universités (professeurs et étudiants) et enfin avec les dirigeants de 1 Association japonaise pour la Société des Hâtions,
D'autre part, je me suis appliqué à avoir des conversations fréquentes avec les dirigeants de la Presse japonaise. Enfin, j'ai pu examiner de près l'organisation et le fonctionnement, un an acres sa création, de notre bureau de Toxio. J'ai discuté avec le chef de ce bureau, il. Aoki, d'une manière suivie, les lignes générales de l1 activité du boireau au cours de l'année à venir,
J'ai réglé, en outre, un certain nombre d'affaires qui m'avaient éré confiées par plusieurs sections du Secrétariat.
III.- iip ves sio ns générales.
Tout d'abord, je dois confesser que j'ai été agréablement surpris de voir le publio de mon pays s'intéresser aux travaux de la Société des Dations et discuter partout d'elle et de son avenir. Cela est dû évidemment à 1'activité croissante de la Société et à sa position influente dans la vie internationale; mais il n'en est pas moins vrai que tel n'aurait pas été le cas, surtout dans un pays aussi éloigné que le Japon, sans les constants efforts pleins de sagesse et de courage par lesquels les amis japonais de la Société des Dations s'efforcent do faire
connaître la raison d'otre de cette institution et son activité
- 5 -
Sur ce point, l’oeuvre de l'Association japonaise pour la Société des Nations mérite toute notre admiration et l'on ne saurait exagérer l'importance du rôle ou1 elle joue jjour la propagation des idées pacifiques dans tooites les classes sociales du Japon.
Créée le 23 avril 1920, l'Association japonaise contient aujourd'hui 5362 membres, dont 698 membres spéciaux payant une cotisation de 12 yen par an, 57 membres à vie, qui paient une unique cotisation do 100 yen; 1872 membres ordinaires qui paient une cotisation annuelle de 4 yen, 115 membres etrangers oui paient aussi 4 yen et 2620 membres amis qui paient une cotisation de 1 yen. Elle a son Secrétariat dans le Bâtiment Kyochokai, Shiba Parle, Tokio, et son bureau d'Europe à Paris, Plie a de fortes sections locales dans les douze grandes villes du Japon et 26 sections estudiantines dans toutes les Universités, ainsi que dans plusieurs collèges du Japon. Elle a, en outre, une section pour les étrangers habitant Tokio, avec plus de 100 membres appartenant à quinze nationalités différentes et une section pour les enfants, s'occupant actuellement de l'échange de correspondance et des travaux Manuels avec les enfants de l'étranger et, enfin, une section des députés comprenant près de 400 membres appartenant aux deux Chambres. Elle se sert du Bureau du Comité national de coopération intellectuelle, qui vient d'être créé dans ses locaux depuis l'année dernière,
les travaux de cette association se font par l'Assemblée (une fois par an), par la Conférence des Directeurs de sections locales (une fois par an), par le Comité des directeurs (dix fois par an) et par les Commissions. Elle publie le "Hevue internationale", qui est son organe mensuel
■>
C-.'
et qui est considérée comme une des revues les plus importantes et appréciées, s’occupant des questions internationales d’aujourd’hui. Cette revue contient des informations larges et exactes sur 1’activité de la Société des Nations et des articles sur les problèmes internationaux de toutes sortes se rapportant à la Société des Nations«
Beaucoup de publicistes connus, ayant une grande influence sur l’opinion publique du Japon, prêtent leur concours» Une autre revue mensuelle de l’Association intitulée ’’le monde et nous-mêmes’1 ( 50 pages) est publiée depuis deux ans et a poTir but de vulgariser l’idée de paix et la morale internationale parmi la grande masse de la papulation (prix fr»0,25).
L’activité de lrAssociation s’exerce, en outre, par les cours d'été, les conférences, les réunions d’étude, les réceptions de personnalités dans le but de discussions, les réunions d’enquête par les experts sur les problèmes internationaux importants, les émissions radiophoniques et enfin, par l’envoi de fortes délégations à la réunion des associations pour la Société des Nations à l’étranger,
La création d’un bureau de liaison de la Section d’information du Secrétariat sous la direction de ¡.I. Aoki a provoqué un rapprochement appréciable entre Tokio et Genève en établissant surtout un contact direct entre l’organisme de Genève et la presse du Japon» Ainsi, grâce à ce bureau de iokio, la presse publie d’une manière régulière et fréquente des nouvelles sur la Ligue, qui font autorité par leur exactitude; et le oublie qui, jusqu’ici, s’intéressait moins à l’institution de Genève elle-même qu’aux diverses mani-
7
festations du Japon envers la ligue, suit aujourd'hui attentivement la marche de la ligue. Les dépêches concer- • nant la Société des Nations sont complétées et annotées par le Bureau.
Le Ministère des Affaires _trangères, dirigé par un Ministre de haute morale internationale, l'Association japonaise pour la Société des Hâtions, composée d'un grand nombre de personnes de l’élite japonaise, et enfin le Bureau du Secrétariat comme trait d’union entre l'organisme de lenève et l'opinion japonaise, ces trois organismes s’entr’aident les uns les autres pour un meme but par des voies différentes et réalisent très heureusement un courant d'idées favorables à la Société des Nations.
Lorsque je suis arrivé au Japon, M. Sugimura, alors directeur du Bureau du Japon pour la Société des Nations, terminait justement un séjour dont le programme était très chargé. Pendant le mois qu'il a passé au Japon, il a été réellement le héros du jour et il n1¿tait pas rare qu'il fit deux conférences ou même trois par jour en dehors des nombreuses entrevues et conversations qu'il a dû accorder. Partout où je me suis rendu, j'ai trouvé un écho retentissant des paroles de il. Sugimura. C'est ainsi qu'a Osaka, encouragé par les paroles de M. Sugimura, un mouvement se produisit en faveur de la libération des filles publiques.
IV,- Quelques traits de mon activité.
Cependant, le passage de .1. Sugimura n'a pas rendu
non travail moins nécessaire; au contraire, ma besogne a été augmentée par le fait même de sa récente visite au
Japon, car jTai dû répondre à l'intérêt que prenait le
rablic japonais à la Société des Nations. Jt
j’ai
dû. malaré
8
mon attitude de réserve, accepter de faire un certain nombre de conférences. Par exemple, j1 ai parlé au Club de Tokio, (le 8 décembre), à la réunion du jeudi (réunion hebdomadaire des rédacteurs, etc,) (le 9 décembre), à l'Auditorium Kokumin organisé par le Journal übkumin, (le 13 décembre), au déjeuner offert par les Directeurs de l'Association japonaise pour la Société ces Dations, (le 21 décembre), à la Réunion générale des Membres de 1'association (le 21 décembre), au dîner du Club Sanshyu, devant les membres de ce club (le 22 décembre), au thé, cher le baron Takahashi (le 23 décembre).
L'état de santé du dernier empereur s'était bien aggravé vers le 23 décembre et vsa mort ayant été annoncée le 25 décembre, toutes les réunions ultérieures de caractère général qui avaient été annoncées, et auxquelles je devais parler, furent supprimées : les Conférences à l'Université de Keio, à l'Université de Meiji, à la l'acuité de Commerce, à la Réunion de la Presse, ainsi que je projet de l'Association japonaise pour la Société des Rations d'organiser pour moi une tournée de conférences en faveur de la Société dans le sud du Japon» Par contre, le dimanche 16 janvier, j'ai pu parler par Radio sur la situation du Japon dans les
relations internationales d'aujourd'hui; d'après les statis-<
tiques du Bureau de transmission radiophonique, l'auditoire de ce jour a pu dépasser le nombre de 300,000
Mon intention de faire des articles plutôt que de donner des conférences s'est révélée particulièrement heureuse étant donné les circonstances dans lesquelles je me suis trouvé dès mon arrivée au Japon : état de santé de l'Ampereur, deuil national ensuite, ouverture du Parlement,
9
bataille acharnée de partis politiques, froid exceptionnel, fin de l'année, etc. les articles suivants, que j'a-
vais préparés, ont été oubliés soit dans la presse, soit dans les revues :

Vers la fin de janvier, le nombre de rendez-vous et d’interviews allant en augmentant, j'ai dû refuser plusieurs invitations à faire des conférences dans les provinces. J'ai consacré volontiers la majeure partie de à aller voir et m’entretenir avec les hommes
mon temos
10
d'Etats, fonctionnaires du Gouvernement, professeurs, Journalistes, hommes d'affaires, qui ont manifesté un vif intérêt à 1’Organisation de Genève et à son développement.
Entre temps, Je me suis efforcé de voir aussi souvent que possible le personnel du Ministère des affaires Etrangères, de l'Association pour la Société des Nations et du Bureau de Tokio, en vue de me tenir en contact étroit et continu avec eux au cours de mon séjour. Ils se sont montrés les meilleurs guides et intermédiaires, soit en arrangeant pour moi les rendes-vous, soit en me fournissant les documents dont j’av&is besoin ou en me facilitant des recherches.
Osaka, où Je me suis arrêté un Jour, J'ai rendu visite à deux grands Journaux, Oska Mainichi et Osaka Asahi, Tous deux, prévenus à l'avance de mon passage, m'ont offert le lunch uu Club des Journalistes, ce qui m'a permis de rencontrer la plupart des Journalistes d'Osaka, devant lesquels J'ai fait un court exposé sur l’organisation du Secrétariat de la Société des Nations et de son activité générale.
A. Kcbe, la veille de mon embarquement, j'ai reçu la visite du Vice-Président et du Secrétaire général de la Section locale de Mobé de 1'Association cour la Société des Nations.
V.- Quelques critiques sur la Société des Nations.
J'ai toujours taché de démontrer aux personnes avec lesquelles je me suis entretenu, le récent développement de la Société des Nations, par suite de l'entrée de l'Allemagne et la situation très importante dans laquelle doit se trouver le Japon parmi les membres de la Ligue. Le Japon
11
siégeant dans le Conseil an meme titre que la France, la Grande-Bretagne, l’Allemagne et 1T Italie, est le seul me mire permanent du Conseil qui ne soit nx puissance européenne, ni partie contractante des Actes de Locarno. Dégagé
des intérêts européens dans une certaine mesure, grande puissonce consultée et écoutée, il peut être amené à jouer le rôle d1arbitre lorsque seront posées, pour décision définitive, les questions qui entraînent les divergences de vue entre les autres membres européens.
Mes interlocuteurs étaient tous bien préoccupés de la marche de la Société des Nations et sTintéressaient à ses travaux de plus en plus importants au point de vue technique. Ils ont tous reconnu, sous une forme ou sous une autre, l’utilité de la Société des Hâtions dans les sphères sociale, intellectuelle, humanitaire, ainsi que la nécessité d’avoir une organisation internationale de paix et d1 harmonie * liais quant à la Société des Nations comme organe politique du monde, le scepticisme se mêïe aux critiques, les uns discutent de l’utilité pour le Jaoon de siéger au Conseil lorsque les gtntr européens seront unis et réccnci-
liés.7111 s doutent, en effet, que les Jtats européens regardent le Japon de bonne grâce lorsqu’ils seront unis. Ils se demandent quel accueil sera alors réservé au Japon, sinon celui que la politesse commande I À leur avis, plus la Société des Nations apaise les convoitises malsaines des nations, c’est-à-dire plus la Société des Nations atteint les buts qu’elle se propose, moins la collaboration du Japon
devient indispensable.”
Le scepticisme des Japonais quant au désarmement des autres ouissances s’appuie sur trois facteurs princi-Daux qui créent dans l’ouinfon publique un courant d’idée
12
défavorable à l’égard ds la Société des Nations. L'établissement de la base navale g. Singapour, la situation politique actuelle des nations voisines sont pour beau*-coup dans l’inquiétude des gens sérieux et honnêtes qui occupent de hautes fonctions au Japon, enfin, l'expérience de 1’”Exclusion Bill de 1924", aux Stats-Unis est encore fraîche dans l'esprit .japonais qui voit le problème d’ immigration oomme une partie du problème de l’égalité des races et du traitement équitable du commerce entre les nations du monde. Ils en éprouvent, par conséquent, une certaine hésitation à suivre "inconsidérément" et "sans trop d'assurance” les desiderata de Genève; les bruits concernant le Pan~Nuropa, les Ntats-Unis d’nurope, le Pan-Américanisme sont aussi des causes de réflexions pro-fondes et d’hésitation sérieuse qui empêchent d’adopter volontiers la cioyanee de ‘Genève. les uns se demandent si les Accords semblables aux Traités de Locarno ne sont pas aussi nécessaires entre les états d’Orient en vue de maintenir la paix en as le ? Le monde marche, disent-ils, vers la décentralisation de la Ligue mondiale ou mieux, vers le régionalisme de la Société dos Nations, liais cette tendance au régionalisme, quelque nobles et parfaits que soient ses buts et son organisation au début, ne ramène-t-elle pas fatalement à la politique d’équilibre d’avant-guerre ? D’autres, se préoccupent de la nécessité de réunir les nations asiatiques pour un échange de vues sur l’opportunité de créer, elles aussi, une Société des Nations asiatique et, si oui, par quels moyens et comment ?
Tant et tant de doutes et de préoccupations à l'égard de la Société des Nations ! Ln somme, ce qu’on répète surtout dans ces conversations, c’est la différence
- IS
d'atmosphère entre Tokio et Genève. On considère l’oeuvre de Genève comme une plante qu'il n’est pas toujours possible de transplanter au Jçpon. Les sarcasmes et les éloges se rencontrent surtout chez les journalistes qui ne semblent pa°, pourtant, etre au courant de 1Tactivité de la Sociéoé d~s Hâtions, quoique ce soient eux qui fassent connaître au Japon l’existence de l’institution de Genève.
VI.- Ja Presse japonaise vis-à-vis de la Société des Nations.
Cependant, il ne faut pas négliger d9 remarquer le fait que la Société des Nations est devenue ainsi aujourd’hui un des sujets favoris de discussion dans la presse japonaise. D’après M. Iwanaga, Directeur de Rengo Tsus-hinsha (A.P* du Japon : la plus grande agence japonaise), parmi les dé peel to de l’étranger qui sont publiées dans la presse du Japon, le plus grand nombre ae rapportent à Ja Chine, ensuite viennent les nouvelles de l’Amérique et de l’Angleterre; les nouvelles de 1& Société des Nations viennent en troisième lieu, avant celles du continent européen et celles de le France. Les grands journaux de ïohio m’ont réservé un accueil plein de sympathie et les rédacteurs du Tolcio Nichinichi et du Tokio Asahi, les deux plus grands journaux de l’Orient, le premier ayant un tirage de l3*i00.000, le second, un tirage de 1.300.000, matin et soir, et le rédacteur de Xokumin m’ont préparé chacun individuellement plusieurs rendez-vous et réunions à l’occasion desquels j’ai pu leur exposer l’activité et 1’organisation de la Société des Nations, et leur repéter la nécessité de collaboration entre la presse japonaise et Genève. ToLio Nichinichi discute en ce moment sur le
14 -
moyen d‘envoyer un correspondant permanent pour la Société des Nations. JTai approuvé et j'ai insisté auprès du rédacteur en chef et du Directeur politique sur la qualité du correspondant qui doit envoyer des nouvelles importantes sur la Société des Dations, ce qui entraînera une dépense considérable pour le journal ; ces nouvelles seront lues par plus dTun million de lecteurs.
iokio nsahi qui envoie à Genève, déjà depuis plusieurs années, un correspondant capable, est désireux de continuer et de renforcer les relations amicales qu1il a pu nouer avec nous. C’est ce journal qui a publié, à la fin de l'année dernière, un annuaire de la Société des Dations avec les préfaces du Secrétaire général et du sous-Secrétaire général, M. Suginrura, - brochure dont lu documentation a été entièrement fournie par II. âoki; du Bureau de Tokio, et qui sert beaucoup à la diffusion des idées et de l’existence de 11 Organisation de Genève.
Quant aux autres journaux ce ïokio, vu la difficulté pécuniaire qu'il y h pour eux d'envoyer un tel correspondant à Genève, je ms suis contenté de nouer de bonnes relations avec eux, en laissant au Bureau de îokio le soin de leur fournir aussi souvent que possible des nouvelles de Genève., a ce propos, lee conversations que j'ai eues à plusieurs reprises avec il. Iv.anaga, Directeur du Rengo Tsushinsha ont été satisfaisantes. Rendo ïsushinoha est une agence d1 informations en forme d'organisation coopérative des huit grands journaux japonais, Depuis sa création, au mois de mai l'an dernier, elle tache de rectifier les erreurs des informations parvenant des agences étrangères et s'efforce ce fournis au Japon les nouvelles exactes dénuées de couleur „.olitique étrangère et nationale et
15
conformas aux demandas et aux aspirations du publie japonais.
La réalisation ce cet ic'c :1 rencontre bien des obstacles qui empêchant le créateur de l1 agence d’aller aussi vite en besogne. Or, le public japonais s’intéresse c'a plus en plus aux problèmes internationaux d’une part et il est du devoir d’une grande agence de mettra le public au courant de l’activité des relations internationales d’autre part.
U. I wma g a considère Genève comme l’un des centres les plus importants ces nouvelles et il s’est préoccupé avec: moi de nommer un correspondant japonais spécial qui aura pour tache d’envoyer à Joldo, par cable, des nouvelles exclusives de la Société des Hâtions, ayant un caractère intéressant tout spécialement le public japonais. Je crois à la réalisation prochaine de ce plan, ainsi qu’à celle du Tohio Niohinicbi dont 43 ne saurais exagérer la valeur réelle au point ce vue de la propagande de la Société des Hâtions au Japon,
711. - Le Japon et la Société des Nations.-
Au Japon, les connaissances sur la Société des Hâtions sont très répandues, mais elles ne sont pas assez profondes.
Lans une école primaire de l’île de Hiushyu, le résultat d’un “mental test" appaiqué à une cinquantaine d’élèves de la sixième classe (il ans) a démontré que la moitié des élèves avait une notion quelconque de lu. Société des Hâtions, et l’un d’eux pouvait seul, paraît-il, donner sur alla une explication satisfaisante. Les Japonais qui savent lire connaissant le nom de la Société des Hâtions. Beaucoup de gens savent que c’est un organisme ninternational“ issu de la xrance guerre et préconisé par le Président Wilson pour le maintien de la paix et de la
16
justice ; mais leurs connaissances sur la Société des nations ne vont pas beaucoup plus loin. Ils ne savent pas sous quelle force elle est internationale, ni par quels moyens elle veut maintenir la paix et la justice, ni où elle en est aujourd’hui dans 1 ' accompli ssement de ses "buts. Souvent le public croit que la Société des Hâtions est dressée contre le sentiment national, que c’est un organe étranger pour faire pression sur les directives d’un pays, et que, enfin, du point ce vue japonais, elle est une institution superflue sinon dangereuse, entraînant pour la nation une perte appréciable d’argent et d’efforts pour en-oourager dans le monde une illusion tronpeuse qui n’est pas conforme à leur conception.
l’opinion que la Société des Hâtions est une institution s’occupant surtout des intérêts européens, incompatible au fond avec la conception asiatique, est assez profonde chez les esprits plus ou moins sensée et éclairés qui aspirent à une paix véritable. Le Japon traverse actuellement, comme d’autres pays, une crise économique très sérieuse. La surpopulation, le manque de débouchés, l'insuffisance des ressources naturelles, etc, rendent la vie au Japon très difficile, et partout on assiste à des scènes pitoyables de misère et de lutte pour la vie. Il est donc compréhensible que les Japonais considèrent comme un luxe, quelque utile at noble qu’elle soit, la Société des Nations avec son siège en ^urope, dirigée par des hommes politiques européens pour s’occuper des affaires se rapportant surtout aux interets de l’Jurope.
la création du Bureau de liaison de la Section d'information a Tckio a été un pas très- heureux, car elle a permis au
17
publio japonais de se mettre en contact direct et permanent N.yao l'Institution de Genève. Oe contact peut -etre efficace et fructueux, si nous arrivons à envoyer des représentants de Commissions (par exemple, de la Commission de Coopération Intellectuelle) ou du Secrétariat de temps à autre, au japon.
De plus, il me semble incontestable que le Chef du Bureau de Tokio ne pourra effectuer sa mission s1il ne lui est pas possible de venir à Genève suivre les travaux de l'Assemblée. Ce point rencontre un grave obstacle budgétaire, étant donné la grande distance qui sépare i'okio de Genève, mais ceci fortifie, d'autre part, la nécessite et l'utilité de cette visite. Je suis d'avis qu'elle doit avoir lieu au moins une fois tous les deux ans, sinon chaque année, pendant la session de l'Assamblée.
le Japon a tiré de la Société des avantagea incontestables, mais il n'est pas moins vrai que la Société des nations n'a pas eu d'occasion de s'occuper des affaires politiques intéressant directement le Japon. 3n d'autres termes, le japon n'a jamais été le "client" de la Société de3 nations, alors qu'aux yeux des Japonais, il y aurait eu bien des problèmes à résoudre pour eux. Les problèmes internationaux qui intéressent jusqu'ioi particulièrement le Japon sont les problèmes se rapportant aux relations entre le Japon et la Chine, entre le Japon et la Russie, entre le Japon et l'Amérique. Or, aucun de ces problèmes n'étant traité p.¡r la Société des Nations, cette dernière est regardée au Japon ar les Japonais surtout comme une institution pacifiste et idéaliste. Des professeurs de droit, les universitaires épris de pacifisme voient dans cette institution la réalisation de leur cher reve, mais politiquement, devant ja réalité des circonstances actuelles de la politique internationale, ils éprouvent une sorte de déception
18
et manifestent des doutas quant au sort futur da la Société des Nations, las visites des hauts fonctionnaires du Secrétariat, celles du Br. Nitobé et du Br. Hajchmann, les quelques réunions internationales au Japon (Conférence des hygiénistes de 1925, Conférence des Croix-rouges orientales, Conférence scientifique du Pan-Pacifique, etc. ), enfin, la tournée de conférence de M. Sugimura ont contribué à rectifier ces opinions, Lorsque l'on a accueilli le Br. Nitobc et U. Sugimura au Japon, lorsque l'on a applaudi leurs conférences sur la Société des Nations, crest à la personnalité meme des orateurs plutôt qu'à la Société des Nations qu'il fallait attribuer le succès de ces reunions j mais l^enthousiaane qui s'est manifesté lnrs des conférences que j'ai faites, les lettres que j'ai reçues à la suite de mes articles, sont le témoignage des progrès réalisés dans l'opinion publique à l'égard fie la Société des Nations, car, dans ce cas, la Société des Nations était la cause principale de l'interet public.
Pour que les Japonais s'intéressent aux travau:. de la Société des Nations, il faut d'abord que cette dernière s'occupe des questions touchant particulièrement le Japon et qu'elle multiplie dans os pa;s les réunions ; la visite des hauts fonctionnaires du Secrétariat ne doit pas etrs négligée.
Pendant le court séjour que j'ai fait au Japon, j'ai reçu des demandes de plusieurs professeurs ce collèges, d'universités, pour un poste quelconque au Secrétariat, Plusieurs de ces professaura m'ont semblé particulièrement sincères dans leurs intentions et dans leur foi en la Société ces Nations, Ix ce sujet, sans avoir l'air de faire une proposition quelconque,
11 me semble que lu proportion de cinq membres japonais au Secrétariat, n'est pas si élevée que l’on doive fefuser à jamais
19 -
la candidature ¿'’autres membres japonais capables et très désireux de collaborer à l’oeuvre de la Société des Hâtions. L’objection qui pourrait être soulevée à l’entrée éventuelle de nos compatriotes au Secrétariat semble résider surtout dans le fuit qu’ils ont certaines difficultés à surmonter, tant $u point de vue de la langue qu’en ce qui concerne leur adaptation aux habitudes et à la conception européennes du travail en commun. i.lais il faut, en meme temps, tenir compte du sacrifice qu’ils font eux-mêmes en quittant leur pays et les postes qu’ils y occupaient, et il est bien évident que les qualités professionnelles des requérants japonais s'amélioreraient s'ils étaient encouragés, d’une manière quelconque, dans leurs efforts.
VIII.- CO HCL US I OH.
En résumé, il nous faut faire preuve d'un réel esprit de collaboration, sincère et effectif, basé sur le respect mutuel et la coopération réciproque entre l'Occident et l'Orient. Afin d’établir un état de paix durable, juste et vrai, véritable but de la Société des Hâtions, il nous faut, avant tout, surmonter les préjugés dont nous sommes imprégnés souvent en ce qui concerne le problème des races et des religions, des différentes cultures et des traditions. Nous voyons des propagandistes européens de la Société des Hâtions prêcher dans des réunions ou dans des revues leur opinion, d'après laquelle la Société des Hâtions serait un organe pour établir la paix par "la civilisation blanche qui est menacée par les races de couleur", préjugé enfantin, mais cependant, très dangereux, qui a fait surgir tant d’obstacles devant les défenseurs japonais de la paix et de la Société ces Nations. De leur coté, les sceptiques japonais, parmi les religieux et les intitutaurs, font à leur tour cette
20
réflexion : qua "la civilisation blanche est loin d’etre supérieurs à la civilisation orientale, et que si l'Occident se déclare plus qualifié pour se conduire partout en .naître, Dieu n'a pas créé, au commencement au nonce, la race blancne pour subjuguer les autres races". Il faut rectifier ce genre d'opinion, nourri de haine et de mépris mutuel et qui résulte des divergences de vues et d'idées. Il faut, coûte que coûte, s'affranchir du préjugé contradictoire et dangereux oui proclame la supériorité d'une race quelconque et flétrit les autres. Oe sera évidemment une campagne de longue haleine et de cur;s épreuves, mais, selon moi, elle, et elle seule permet d'espérer la possibilité d'atteindre les buts de la Société des Dations. Tant que ce préjugé dressera une barrière entre l'Occident et l'Orient, mille autres efforts de la Société des Hâtions seront vains,
o
o o
Un jour prochain, le continent européen peut se sentir en sécurité. Il faudrait éviter de donner l'impression que cette heureuse unité européenne est une menace contre le développement national des autres continents, le Japon et l'Orient ont besoin de la plus grande compréhension ce l'Occident, de meme que l'Occident a besoin de la collaboration la rIus efficace du Japon et de l'Orient.

Sir Bernard Hallet came to see me this afternoon in order to explain to me the purposes of the World Population Conference which was to he held in Geneva next week:. He eaid that some false impressions had been created v;ith regard to this Conference. It was really a congress of scientific men, biologists, etc., who were to meet together to discusB, from a purely scientific point of view, such questions as the maximum population which a State should have, the incidents of birth rate among the various classes of the population, and similar questions. The Conference had been convoked on the initiative of certain American scientists. It had no propagandist purposes in view but the result might be the creation of a small international body to watch the development of the problems which he had mentioned.
I asked him whether emigration and immigration questions were not going to be discussed.
He said* 1 that this vag so and that M. .¿Libert Thomas mas goin-'’’ to read a paper on the subject. Ee added that various people had asked whether the question of Birth Control was going to bo treated. He had replied that this v^as certainly not the casef and that if it had been, he would have had nothing to do with the Conference. The name of llrs . Banger, who had been prominent in promoting the Conference, was associated with the movement I had mentioned, but he had got a definite promise from her that no discussion of the question would take place.
-2-
I said to him that, as fax as I could see, the Conference v;as going to discuss questions which roused the strongest national feelings and which were of a very delicate character» Further, such matters as the regulation of the population would excite religious fee lings c I had felt that it would he extremely dangerous for the Secretariat to have any official cognisance of the Conference.
V/e had to he extremely careful not to lay ourselves open to any attach and it was for this reason that I had declined his invitation that the Secretariat should he represented officially at the Conference. At the same tine, I did not, and indeed I could hardly, object to individual members of the Secretariat attending privately. Ee had ashed in his letter whether I would not , ive the Conference benevolent neutrality. I should prefer neither to show benevolence or malevolence but to maintain absolute neutrality * I hope that he would understand the reasons for such a course.
Sir Bernard Uallet seemed fairly satisfied, and at any rate I think that it has done good that he should have realised the'league's position in the matter.

lióte by the Secretary-General and Memorandum "by the Treasurer.
I circulate, herewith, a very interesting memorandum by the Treasurer with regard to the probable increases in the League Budget and possible consequences.
I am really alarmed at the growth shewn by the finarss. Ehila the position will be serious in 1928, it will become more so in 1929, unless Brazil and Spain ultimately do not "1 thdrav;, as it is only in 1929 that the full financial effects of the departure of these two countries ^:ill be shev/n.
I feel that the assembly is not lively to raise difficulties as long as the total Budget of all the League Organisations does not emceed 25,000,COO francs; but the 1928 Budget, if all the proposed supplementary votes are passed will reach more than 25 and-a-half millions^
Obviously, as the Treasurer points out, the only method of economising lies in curtailing the number of Committees and Conferences, and spreading the activities of the Technical Sections over a longer period. No further economies in administration are possible.
I must, therefore, ask; the Directors, and specially those concerned with Technical organisations, tc consider

seriously the situation, and see whether some of the fresh activities proposed for 1928 cannot he postponed till 1929.
If we cannot ourselves obtain these results, then I think a joint suh-C omul t tee of the Second and Fourth Committees is likely to he set up to examine the proposals of the various Technical Organisations and tc decide which activities shall he given priority in 1928 up to a limit of a total Budget of 25 million francs.

The SEGr>E TAB Y -3EIIABAI„
The annexed statement ,T^.T* gives a comparison between the years 1927 and 1928 of the Budgets c>f the three organisations.
The budget for 1927 was ,........... 24,512,341
The revised budget for 1928 is ..... 25,668,322
.an increase of ......... .	1,155,981
In accordance with the recommendation of the Supervisory Commission we are returning to Member States from
the surplus of 1926 . .............................. 873,626
The actual increase with which States will be burdened is therefore ..................... 282,355
This sum will, however, be xeduced because it is now understood that the increase in the cost of living, figures in respect of which are nr:: being prepared, do not justify so large an estimated supplementary addition of 200,000 francs; the sum required will probably not reach 100,000. If therefore it were not for the loss we will sustain ty the ’withdrawal of Spain and Brazil from the league in 1928, the increase of contributions for 1928 over 1927 would be normal and reasonable. This estimated loss is, however, 634,5C8 frs. (Anneocure AA) and the total estimated increase of contributions from States for 1920 will accordingly be 916,923, a figure which, though perhaps fully justified, is likely to draw forth a good deal jf adverse criticismo It should, however, be emphasised that the cost of administration is not responsible for this increase which is due to abnormal growth in the duties imposed upon the
league. Reductions in the budget can only he effected by a curtailment of league activities and in that respect the ddmini-
stration is of course in the hands of the assembly.
Hi is
fact v/ill be apparent vihen vie examine the increase of the Secretariat budget item for item, Á general examination of the budget of the League would not be complete without reference to the Building fund. This fund was created in 1925, and including the International Labour Office and the value of the Hotel Rational amounted to 2C,702,841 frs. Ls the Fund was created out of surpluses obtained by the prompt and regular payments of contributions by certain states and also by their excessive or disproportionate contributions, a plan of refund in similar proportion to the payments was devised. Under this plan the refund would be made over a period of 15 years by a payment of 1,4(X ,000 annually. 1,375,00c. thereof was to be budgeted for and 25 ,000 taken from the Building Fund which is invested at interest ranging from 4-^ to 5fi.	The refund cf the
1926 amount v/ss effected by reducing the contributions due for 1927, and the amount was therefore available for financing ourselves on January 1st 1927. If, therefore, the budget for 1928 did not include such a provision, the refund would only be withheld in 1929, the contributions for that year being commensurately increased.
It might at first sight seem strange that -while, on the one hand a refund is mode, on the other contributions are required but it must be understood, that the refunds are made according to the basis of payment over the years during which the surplus was created and contnbu ticns are required according to an entirely new and different allocation of expenses of the League. Perhaps another system of adjustment could have been devised but there is no doubt of the resultin: accuracy of this one. It is perhaps a little involved, and the meticulous care
~ 5 -
which is taken to adjust oyer a period of 15 years the ownership the fund to the proportions provided by the statement of the Allocations of expenses is admirable. After this period has elapsed the fund will be owned by Member States in exact proportion tc the basis of contribution. The accuracy of this basis (i.e. the allocation) may be a subject cf doubt and there are possibly therefore factors mitigating against the infallibility of our method. It is perhaps unfortunate that
of
the allocation of expenses is subject to fluctuation and that the Committee responsible for the allocation may have views or a base of operations wrth which other Member States are not familiar or with which they are possibly not in agreement. It is, moreover, upsetting to find that in 1926 we only collected from States the sum cf 1,192,350 instead of 1,375,000 and that we had to draw upon ourselves for 182,550, the effect being of course to reduce our surplus by this amount. A newcomer may possibly be forgiven for believing that the adjustment between States may not be fully appreciated or understood and that there is no reason why the League should before long not become a legal persona and own property as such. When that occurs we might satisfy States by keeping a set of books indicating the extent to which each contributed to the assets of the League.
I am fearful that some mathematical minded individual might suggest that this meticulously accurate method should be applied not only to the immovable property of the League but also to the valuable and lasting movable property’. Of course such an extension is not feasible but I must say that I am entirely in accord vith you that this refund might reasonably be withheld during any year in vihich our finances are precarious. This would not mean a reduction of contributions but merely a reduction cf tbs budget. I do not, however* think that this position
6
has ye o arisen Tilth the 192 3 budget although I am greatly disappointed to find its rapid growth» I wonder whether there is any possibility of Directors being able to make any suggestions for substantial reductions of their sectional budgets!
II» Analysis of the Secretariat Budget for 1928.
Statement TtBtT gives the percentage increases and decreases compared with 1927.
It will be noticed that 10 items out ox 31 show abnormal increases and. the following brief explanations of these increases are offered
Item 4 - Salaries, wages and allowances.
The increase would be quite normal were it not for the proposed restoiation ox salaries owing to the alleged increase in the cost ox living. 'we can, however, eliminate moBt of this increase. The estimate was unduly high in the first instance but it is now understood that the cost of living figures being compiled justify only a small increase.
I tern 5 - Contribution to the Staff Provident Fund.
This is due to the normal progression of salaries and to the conversion of appointments from temporary to permanent.
Item 6 - South American Liaison.
This is due to a provision of 150,000 for a proposed mission to South America and to an increase by 50,000 of the provision for correspondents etc.
I tern 10 - Property account.
This is due to the necessity for hiring further
/1
office accommodation resulting from the growth of the activities of the league.
7
Item 11 - Publications.
The small increase here is entirely reproductive -see the estimated increase of sales.
Item 12 - General Office expenses.
The increases are due to the increasin' requirements of stationery and paper and to postage.
Item IG - Unpaid Liabilities account.
The increase is abnormal. It is, however a book adjustment and does not mean that we will spend more.
Item 17 - supervision of revenue and expenditure.
The increase is due to provision being made for a meeting of the Committee on Allocation of Expenses.
I ten 22 - Transi t.
A supplementary credit of 60,000 francs rill probably be required for the systematic collection and distribution cf information on communications and transit.
Item 26 - Intellectual Co-operation.
The increase of 25,000 francs i3 due to the convocation,
in 1928, of a Congress on Popular Arts.

30TË BY THE SECKSTABY-GEMAL.
I promised to submit to one of the nert meetings of the Council suggestions as to the Rapporteurs of the coming year.
I have considered the matter somewhat carefully, and have drafted the accompanying list of subjects and possible Rapporteurs. I should be glad to know whether the Under Secretaries General and Directors agree to these proposals.
The point as to which I have considerable doubt, and on which Sir Arthur Salter might express an opinion, is the choice between Bin land and Canada for Questions 1 and 16.
The main questions, of course, relate to Poland and Italy, and therefore we should endeavour ceforehand to get Polish consent to the proposed arrangement *
The matter is of urgency, and I should be grateful, therefore, for any observations at the earliest possible moment.

Hr. WI1SCNTS VISIT TC N3W zbaland.
With reference to my forthcoming visit to New Zealand there is, perhaps, not much likelihood of any sf the Sections have questions v;hich they would like me to put to the Hew Zealand Government while I am there, hut, in case they should have, the fact of my visit might perhaps be made known to them.
As you know, I am going out across Americas via Montreal, and could doubtless take Ottav?a on the may, in the unlikely event of there being any question which it would he more convenient to discuss there than with the Canadian
Office here.
Similarly, I could, if it være thought desirable, return, våthout incurring any extra expense to speak of, via Mel bourne.	But I should normally return also by the direct
route across America.
Perhaps it might be useful for Sections to know this on the remote chance that I could be of service to any of them in either of those two capitals. That is just possible, as, so far as I can ascertain, it may be a year or so before Canadian or .Australian members of the Secretariat visit Canada or Australia respectively©
