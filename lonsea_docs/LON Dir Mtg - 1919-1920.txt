The S3CH TARY»G\L said that the situation had undergone no apecial development since list reek. ith regard to the Labour Conference, he had heard fror a rivt.te source that the probability wig that Germany would not bo invited to attend as a member, but that It might po ssibly be suggested that some German representatives should attend as the guests of the Conference. If she were not invited, this would, of course, have some bearing on the problem of the submission to the Assembly of the ouestiun of Germany1a admission to the Longue.
He was more and more convinced that the move to Geneva ought to be made t ia year. Under the present ciro'«ietancce, peonle did o t realise the existence of the League, and existence in a big, national Capital reacted in isolation.
The Mandates Commission would probably moot soon to disouaa the terms of "A’1 mandates - i.e. those under wMch territories formerly part of the ' urkiah empire were to be governed.
The nestings of representatives fro: the Institutes of Agriculture anti Statistics had been of great use. The question of the taking over by tho League of the International
Institute
2
Institute of Agriculture was now under consideration, and was one which should be proceeded with with great care and deliberation, since it was the first case of its kind, and would, to some extent, be a precedent for the future.
Mr. SALTISH said that he was proposing to circulate a full Report of the meeting in question. Ho binding conclusion had, of course, been reached, but some agreements had been arrived at, w* ich would appear ir. the Report* After some discussion, it was agreed that the situation in America would necessitate delay in forming the committee which was called for by the above-mentioned agreements.
As regards the International Economic Council, it had been intender that it should hold its first full meeting in Washington not later than September 15th, but as no invitations had yet been sent out by the United States Government, it was hardly possible for it to meet so soon. There wore good reasons for hoping the meeting would be held as aoon as possible, not only because particular questions required discussion, but from the League of iations point of view; beoauae the I.E.C. repre anted a continuation of the new form, which had sprung up during the War, of international consultations of points where the action of a national government vitally affected other countries. If such consultations were dropped for a period of six or eight nonth3, it would not be easy to restart then. The question had not been decided wh At ought to be done if the United States did not issue invitations for a considerable period. He thought there should be a meeting of those who were willing to meet at once, which should however, avoid discussing questions of a dan, e >;s nature, e.g, wheat,
Mr. F03DICK said that he had arranged for new a to reach the Public Information Section by wireless from the United States, beginning on August 21st.

Mr. COLBAiT r«narked that It was a pity that the Press seemed often not to realise the difference between the duties of the League and those of the Allied and Associated Powers, particularly as regards the responsibility for keeping order, etc. in plebiscite territories; this was not the duty Of the League; but, seeing that the League was frenuently a?tacked in the Press for not carrying it out, the inhabitants of the territories in ouestion night feel that the League had failed to do its duty towards then. It war. decided that he should consult M. Cornert as to the stens to be taken to correct this impression.
Dr. -IITOBS said he was going to Brussels on Sunday, August 24th, with Mr. Lloyd, and Mr. Kaeckenbeeck, to visit the Union des Associations Rationales. At Dr. Van Hamel’s suggestion it was agreed that the party should try and visit the Hague on the way back, in order to get into touch with the International Intermediary Institute there.

The SECRSTAKV GENERAL said that the position of the League in America had beeome more critical since the last Meeting, hut it mist he remembered that the President had not yet started his campaign. He considered that it was more Important than ever for the Secretariat of the League to avoid anything which could provide ammunition for its opponents in America. For this reason it would be best for the present not to maRe any further appointments to the staff.
MR, FOSDXCK, Mi© agreed With the Secretary -tenoral, -said that he thought even if America did not come in this year she could not possibly remain out long. He considered that the only external appeal which might influence Americans at the present moment would bo ono corning from Belgium.

The SECRETARY GENERAL said that'the question whether Meetings of the Council could be held as soon, as three Powers other than Germany had ratified was still being discussed in Paris. He hoped for a decision in the near future.

Captain .¿alters.
The Secretary General said that the information received since the last meeting seemed to show that it,was unlikely that the Treaty would come into force until the decision of the United States Senate had been taken.
He then read a memorandum (attached) on the probable development of the activity of the League in the immediate future.
Sir Herbert Ames suggested, and the secretary General agreed, that the list of items for the Council to consider should probably include a budget covering the period up to 31st March 1920.
It was only possible now to put in a six months’ estimate and it would be a rough one at that; but there was much to be gained by getting the Council's sanction for this estimate. It would be difficult to ask for the allocated shares before that sanction had been obtained. In passing, he remarked that it would probably be desirable to ash for a somewhat larger amount than we should actually spend. He wanted to have a bank balance to meet expenses during that part of the following financial year, which would precede payment of their shares by tne members.
The Secretary General said that it was desirable to consider the question of who ought to attend the Assembly, He asked the Directors to consider after seeing the agenda, whether they would need to attend personally, and if so, whom they must take with them, if not, whether their sections ought to be represented. He asked them to put down the names of those whose special knowledge made them indispensable, and also a statement cf what stenographers, etc.
would be wanted. Of course it was desirable, for reasons of economy ana space, that the smallest number compatible with efficiency should he taken; The United States Government could supply the necessary mechanical staff, so far as English was concerned; but it was stated that it was cheaper to send out stenographers from England, paying their fares and subsistence allowances, than to engage them on the soot, The question was also raised whether it eight he necessary to charter a special steamer to take to America the 1-rge number of delegates and their staffs from Europe, which with the staff of the Secretariat might amount altogether to about 700 people.
Mr. Salter said that the Secretariat should consider what to do if the bus and tram employees came out. It might be worth while to hire a car to collect workers living outside ’walking distance, ] . was agreed that the Internal Committee should enquire into the possibility to getting temporary accommodation in the neighbourhood.
¡air Herbert nmes said that he would shortly circulate an inter! budget of a very rousfr nature, and asked whether he should cireulat,-it as a whole or send to each Section that part which specially coneernea it. The Secretary General said that it should be circulated as a whole.
sir H.Ames said that his report on the allocation of Leagae expenses was now in the hands of the Secretary General, It would no doubt soon be circulated, and he 'would then greatly value the views of members of the Secretariat on the fairness of the assessment made for their own countries.
Monsieur Varlez said that the coming Labour Conference still gave rise to controversy.
first, there was the question whether she United States would take part if their Senate had not yet ratified the Treaty, Second,
. the question whetherthe orkers should send representatives. The was an inconsistency between Monsieur Clemenceau's promise of a definite invitation for ex-enemy Stales,,and the Supreme Council's decision merely to put no obstacle in the way of their goins to
Washington. Hr. Gonpers had suggested that the original labour Commission should meet in Paris. The Council of Five had declined to call it together until they knew what subjects it &iould discuss. Monsieur Vandervelde had written to Mr. Barnes that the position as regards ex-enemy States was net satisfactory, ant urging a meeting of the .Commission at Paris. Mr. Barnes replied that British Trade Unions had accepted v/ithout reservations the invitation to go to Washington, and he was against a further meeting.
The Secretary General said that he understood that M.Jouhaux and the French Trade Unions had agreed to send to Washington.
Monsieur Varlez quoted on the other side an interview publishe on September 20 by the Butch newspaper "Het Volk”, in which the President of the Union des Syndicats declared that the Germans woul not be satisfied with the Paris decision, and that Scandinavian Labour would take the same point of view,
Mr. Fosdick said that Mr. Gum;pars approved of the Paris decision, so that it appeared that there was a split between the American, French and British Trade Unions on the one side, and some of the other Labour Parties on the other.
The Secretary General said that it was clear that there would be a Conference, ant the ¿secretariat must be represented at it.
This was, for practical purposes, all that it was immediately necessary for us to know,
Lr. can Hamel referred to the question of disarmament. In many countries, particularly in Switzerland and Holland, enthusiasm for the League was in proportion to the desire for limitation of armaments. Were any steps being taken now to promote it?
The Secretary Genoral hoped that the question would be thrashs out in the Assembly, and practical steps could then be taken. As regards the Permanent Commission to advise on disarmament - in this country the tvar Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry were now ascertaining one another's views.
Mr._Saltor saic that th- personnel cf the Commission was very
important, and that he hoped that this would be realised.
-4-
The Secretary General said that the Admiralty certainly realised the importance of appointing a first-rete representative, and held the view, which he personally thought was important - viz: that the propresentatives should s eek in the nun.; of th-.ir respect Departments, and not he appointed. by the League,

Cap	tain Valters.
The Secretary General said that the question of ratification of the Treaty had taken a new turn today, through the action of Italy. He understood that Colonel House, before ho left Trance, had come to an agreement with the Trench Government that the Treaty should not come into force until the United States had ratified it; but in reaching this decision he thought that Monsieur Clemenceau and Colonel House had acted on the assumption that Italy would take no action until her Parliament met, about December 3rd, and they therefore expected that it would, be ratification y Trance, Great Britain and the United States which would bring the Treaty into force, and that the Council could thus meet with full representation. There had still existed differences of opinion as to the proper agenda for the Council, and the number and place of its
iree tings.
Since then, Italy had announced her definite ratification He could not tell for certain how this fact would affect the situation. He had telegraphed to Paris to find out what the Trench Government intended, and had also asked His -majesty's Government the same question.	It appeared that we should be back in the
position anticipated a few weeks ago, and would have to return to the scheme of a single formal meeting in Paris to appoint the Saar Basin Delimitation Commission. He ought to bo ready to deal with this a fortnight hence.
Mr. Colban said that Monsieur Veuizelos had asked when the Council meeting was likely to be, as he was very anxious to be
present.
The Secretar:/ General said that he could not se,y yet, hut would let him know the moment anything was settled.
If the above assumption was realised, no section would he required in Paris except Hr. Cellar's. Its agenda could net include such matters as confirmation of appointments and approval of the Secretariat budget until the United States member was -present. Eis own strong opinion was. that as soon as the American
Senat	e ratified, there	s	hould be three or foui meet	in go	of	the	
Con no	il to consider th	.0 O	e and other matters.				
	Ueanwhile, h		thought we might well ask I	Kj a j. u	to	pay	.L j- ty

Kg asked the opinion of the meeting, and particularly of these who mere nationals of States formerly neutral, as to the advisability or otherwise of holding in Paris the meeting of the Council which would deal with matters not arising cut of the Treaty of Peace. He personally was afraid that this might give the impression that the Council was in the nature of a conti station of the Peace Conference, and thought that London, or possibly Brussels, would be a better place to hold them..
Hr. Golban and Dr. 'Van Earnel both thought that the neutrals as such would have no objection to the meetings being in Paris, though Mr, Cellan thought the political atmosphere of Paris and in a lesser degree of London also, to be not altogether favour able to the discussion of the particular questions with which his section was concerned, 5r, Van Hamel drew attention to the opinion that the League was subject in too great a measure to Anglo-Saxon control. Council meetings in London foil wd by the Assembly meeting in 'Washington would give siren fh to this criticism, Both agreed that'Brussels would be suitable, although it was pointed cut that a belief was not uncommon that Geneva had been given up as the seat of the League, and precautions must be taken to prevent any colour using given to this mistake, as a result of holding Council meetings in Brussels. It was generally agreed that the best solution would be the first formal meeting in Paris, four or five meetings in Brussels, any further meetings in London until the Assembly meetdag in Washington. It was suggested that there should also be a meeting at Washington shortly before the meeting of the Assembly, and this was agreed to, if found necessary.

Minutes of a Meeting held in the Secretary General’s Room, on Jeanesday, October 22nd,1919 at 3.30.p.m.
Present
The Secretary General Monsieur Monnet Dr. Uitobe Sir Herbert Ames Mr. Oolban Monsieur Comert Mr. Salter Dr. Tan Hamel Captain Gilchrist Captain Walters.
The Secretary General said that he had recently received a report from the British Delegation in Paris, to the effect that the Treaty was likely to come into force next week. In view of this, he had had meant to go to Paris on Priday* Monsieur Monnet, however, had now given him a different account of the matter, and the proposed visit could, he thought be safely postponed, at any rate until next week,
Labour Conference. Mr. Wilson, rhe American Secretary for labour, had issued a statement in the press, implying the possibility that, if the United states had not ratified and therefore could not attend the Conference and if, as was possible, other States invited to send delegates were in the same position, the Conference would think it necessary to adjourn until a later date. In reply to a telegram from us, Mr. Baiter had said that this statement had been based exclusively on the legal possibilities of the situation, 4hat the Conference would meet in any case, and would decide its own future. This, he thought, was satisfactory, as they were certain to go ahead with their discussions.
As regares adhesions of "invited" states.
there was nothin,?
new to report.. All were waiting to see what the United states would do.
Monsieur Monnet sain that during his stay in Paris, the quest: of the coming into force of the Treaty had gone through various
stages./
1.
o
*“ C^—
stages. uhen the Italian ratification ‘became known, the first view taken was that it would he best to bring the Treaty into force at once, and base the action upon the ratifications by Prance, Great Britain and Italy. Then.Jiowever, it was realised that the coming into force of the Treaty entailed two sets of problems:-
1,	the carrying out of the actual measures to be taken immediately on the coming into force of the Treaty -e.g., the holding of plebiscites and the appointment and despatch of various Commissions;
2,	the problem connected with the position of Germany on the coming into force cf the Treaty.,
As to 1, when the work of monsieur TardieuTs Committee on the Execution of the Treaty was reviewed, it was found that for some Commissions arrangements were ready and appointments made; for others not;,
Por the nlebiscitos the presence of Allied troops was nece sary and in
no case were they effectively on the ground.
acme a
;he Au-
preme Council had imt yet agreed as to tneir position. All these points must be seen to in order to bring the Treaty effectively into force,
As to 2, it was found that Germany had in some respects not carried out the conditions of the Armistice, especially with regard to the evacuation of the Baltic Provinces. Should the treaty come into force immediately, the armistice would lapse, and to enforce its terms it would be necessary to have recourse to the machinery of the league of Nations, which would evidently in the circumstances be a long and difficult affair,
Finally, there was the situation in the United States. v»ithcut the participation of the United otates it was very difficult to bring the Treaty and the league into operation, and it seemed possible that, by the time the tasks outlined under headings 1 and 2 had been performed, the United States might have given its decision,
The Supreme Council is now, therefore, pressing the Allied Governments to nominate members of Commissions and to make the preparations for the necessary military occupation; pressing Germany tu carry out the terms of the armistice; and hoping that the United States may by then have ratfisd the Treaty, or be on the point of Going so-
-3-
This plan was not forrally adopted by the Supreme Council, but he thought he could confidently assume that this would be the course taken. ,7e could take it that three reeks at least :ould elapse before the coining into force of the Treaty. The message from Paris published in this morning’s press :as only a suggestion made by a official, and was not adopted by the Supreme Council.
Hr. Colban said that he had been looking through his Memoranda, and thought that the fresh delay would not necessitate any alteration in them.
Sir Herbert Ames said that his schedule of apportionment of expenses was very nearly ready, hut further action could not be taken until the Treaty should have come into force.
The question was mooted of asking the Trench Government for their share. Other members had been asked as and when they ratified.
Monsieur Monnet thought that, if our financial position allowed us to wait until the Council had held a meeting before asking the Trenoh Government, the necessary operation of getting the Parliamentary assent to the further contribution (which had not been asked for for the first contribution) would be made much easier.
Hr. Salter said the fresh delay caused much difficulty with regard to the problem of the countries of chief industrial importance.
The Council ought to decide this question before the break up of the Tabour Conference, as dates can now he forseen we shall be running matters very close. The problem would perhaps have to go to the very first meeting of the Council. He thought now that it would not he necessary to communicate again with the Governments concerned, as the existing data, though not complete, gave sufficient ground for forming a judgment. The question was now reduced to a fairly narrow compass, as two of the claimants had little chance.
The Secretary General suggested telegraphing to Jr. Fosdick, telling him the position and urging that the Governments should settle the matter between themselves, the delegates acting as GbW'etrcment representatives and not as a Conference.
Monsieur Monnet/
-4-
Urmsie^r 'Tonne t thought there would be very little chance that the Council woulfl have time to give a decision. They could not be expected to settle so important a question in a few days, which they would undoubtedly refer to their Ministers or expert advisers at home. The suggestion that a provisional agreement might be reached in rashington to be confirmed later by the Council, was, he thought,
open to the same criticism. The delegates would only refer to their home Governments, A decision was improbable unless the Governments had already been unofficially approached, had had the proposal explained to them and been engaged to instruct their delegates to support it.
It was agreed, for the present, to cable to Ilr. Tos&ick, ex-plaining the situation and asking for his views. On the receipt of his report we could then consider what action, if any, should be taken by the Secretariat.
In reply to a question from Mr. falter, the Secretary General said that as regards the date of the Assembly nothing could be said more than that it would be about ten weeks after the coming into force of the Treaty, irrespective of whether the United States had ratified or not.

Present:-
The Secretary General Dr. Hitote Sir Herbert nmes ...onsieur Oomert Dr. van Hamel Mr. Salter Captain Gilchrist Captain waiters.
The Secretary General gave a brief accoant of the results of his [visit to Paris. A proposal had been submitted to the supreme Council by the Drafting Committee of the Peace Conference, and accorfing to the records had been generally accepted, to the effect that a Council meeting should be held in Paris immediately the Treaty came into force, in
order to make the appointments of the Saar Basin Delimitation and Gcvern-
tng Commissions and of the High Commissioner for i»ansig. This was lot to represent the real sentiment of xhe French, American and British overnments, and Mr. Polk had now agreed with the French Government tq> sk the President to call a meeting in Paris,to deal with the appointment f the Saar Delimitation Commission only. This meeting would not receive my considerable publicity. The French Government was anxious to wait Intil the American Senate had ratified the Treaty before appointing the ®aar Governing Commission, as thoy wished to have an American member of hat Commission. Sir Gyre Crowe had sent a telegram, *n the S.G’s sug-
gestion, to the British Government, asking for their approval of this arrangement. He was not aware that an answer had yet been sent.
As regards the probable date of tne coming into force of the Treaty, at the time when he left London November llth was regarded as a probable ;dute. on arrival in Paris he found this would be impossible. The arranyt !ments for holding plebiscites and for ensuring the fulfilment of the -armistice conditions (for which a protocol was to be drawn up) involved further delay, and the date would probably be about the end of the month,
He/

The British Government has ap roved and the Supreme Council has definitely resolved on this recommendation.

He had received information from Paris containing seme points of i utero so:
Hungary, The Treaty was ready for présentâtio,. to the Hungarian lovernment as soon os a Government existed with which negotiations were possible, and efforts were being made to assist the establishment of such Government.
'Bulgaria. It was anticipated that the Treaty would be signed next
week.
Boumania, Tho opposition of Monsieur Bratiano’s party to the
l M
■iinorities Treaty remains at present unabated.
Jugo-SIavia.The Serbian Government!s attitude to the Minorities treaty was not uncompromising, ..but, a final solution was delayed by the failure to settle the Adriatic question between Jugo-Slavia and Italy.
Hr, galter said that the memoranda which his section had prepared on (1) The economic I'eapon;
i(2} The eight Chief Industrial Countries.
;ere both ready for printing as Council documents
One consequence of the postponement of the meeting of the Assemble mas that it had become important for the Secretariat to establish reflations of some kind, with the Supreme Economic Council. There was to 1
|>e a meeting of the permanent Committee of that Counoil on November 6th,
I which he proposed to attend. The International Economic Council does ■lot exist as yet, owing to the fact that the United States Government had not been able to give its agreement to the scheme. He intended fo i r.p to Home at the end of this month to visit the Institute of Agriculture, and hope that an opportunity might arise at the same mime to
Ittend a meeting of the Supreme Economic Council, which was expected to
I
Be hoid there at that time, Eis hope was, that the Supreme Economic Council would instruct their permanent Committee to collaborate with the International Secretariat. It was agreed that this plan would be ■nobjectionable, tkougn it would not be desirable for the International leoretariat to take the initiative in promoting this collaboration,
■
:	He /
He had also attended the meetings in London of the Fight the Famine Council. The meetings hod not been a groat success, as except for Professor Brentanu, and some notable British economists, no economists cf eminence had attended. Invited to tale part in the discussions, ho had felt compelled to decline. One special matter of interest emerged from the meeting - namely, that many of the speakers pressed for the League of lations to take an active part in dealing with European Economic problems. Sir George Eaish especially had an important paper on the League and the financial necessities cf various States. We might expect that an authoritative proposal signed by nationals of various European states would shortly be presented t,- the Council on this point..
The Bcomornic and Financial Section would be in a position to produce a statement summing up all the authoritative pronouncements and investigations which had been made on this matter, provided that they could get leave to use the contents, of an important report prepared in Paris which was now regarded as confidential.
Sir Herbert umes enquired whether there would probably be set up an International Financial Commission.
Mru Salter said there would be an Eeoncmic Council and an International Currency Commission, but probably not an International Financial Commission, as this subject would be within the sphere of the International Economic Council.
Sir Herbert Ames said that he '.ms expecting tc receive tod: y the first proef of the League Budget. It was agreed that crpies should be circulated to the Sections for their suggest ions. He remarked that it was found very difficult to get exact equivalents in French and English for every necessary t.,rm - e.g., for such a word as "section".
On the question cf th« financial relations between the League
and /
4
• y
f.
snd International Bureaux, a Conference was proposed to be held when Monsieur Monnet returned. It was later decided to fix the time of this meeting for Tuesday, November lith, at 4 o’clock.
He asked whether we proposed to introduce a pension or annuity system for members of the Secretariat. The question became acute in the cases of Civil Servants who, when they joined the Secretariat were already in possession of certain pension rights-. The Secretary general said that he was not anxious to raise this question just now. The Organisation Committee had agreed to recommend to their Governments that service in the International Secretariat should not affect the pension rights of Civil Servants, and tjae r of »go that the period of service should count towards pension; but at that time they were contemplating a period of service of five years. In the case cf longer periods, they might hot be so ready to agree tc this arrangement. Soon, h«wever, it would be necessary to produce a scheme.
Captain Gilchrist mentioned the subject of the conveyance to I 'Washington of the Gorman delegates to the Labour Conference. Those neutral and Allied delegates who had net secured a passage before I Monday last had now travelled on a lT.S. troop-ship, but for the 14 German delegates no travelling accommodation had yet been found. The
newspaper report that some of those delegates .ore already in America I -vas a mistake.

CONEIDENTIAL.
MINUTES of a Meeting held in the Secretary General's Room., on Wednesday. 12th November 1919, at '¿.30 p.m.
Present:
The Secretary General: Monsieur Monnet;
Dr. Nitobe;
Sir Herbert Ames;
Mr. Colban;
Monsieur Comert;
Dr. Van Hamel;
Mr. Salter;
Captain Valters.
The Secretary General said that the Supreme Council had agreed that the first meeting of the Council should be held in Paris dirend ly after the coming into force of the Treaty and should deal only with the Saar Basin Delimitation Commission. They were still disensing the question of whether the meeting should be on the same day or. which the Treaty came into force, or two days later. They were also considering the possibility of the United States ratifying by that time, and now suggested that the Agenda should not be officially settled until we knewr whether this will be 30 or not. This created an awkward situation for us, though probably the United States would not have ratified so soon. He had ’written to Paris, strongly urging that the present decision should he kept to. The Counoil could the: itself decide the time, the place and the agenda for its next meeti: He had heard from Monsieur Varlez, who said that the feeling amongst the delegates to the Labour Conference towards the League o. Nations was most satisfactory. The only oriticism was that the lanei national Secretariat was too bourgeois. There would certainly be something to be said for having some labour men on the Secretaria but he agreed that we were not representatives of any class or any party, and ought simply to try to get the host man for each job.
On the subject of communication between the British Government Departments and the Secretariat, an arrangement had been sanctioned this week by the British Cabinet. If the development was as he hoped, there wt.uld be officials in each Department entitled t> ••• r respond with, then oposite numbeis in the	bariaf Tb . - or--
t
respondence would go to a central office, which would be under
the/
the Prime Minister. not under the Foreign Office, though the Foreign Office vvill he kept informed. The Secretary of the central office had net yet been appointed, hut he would probably be appointed specifically as such, and not as simply one of the Cabinet Secretaries.
The Treaty might come into force on the 25th or 27th November A few of the Secretariat would have to go across,
Monsieur Hcnnct said that he desired to speak about the Labour Conference. It was faced with groat difficulties, and he thought tho present situation a most serious one. Llonsieur Vario £ wrote optimistically, but the fact v/as that tho men in bashing": t. lacked contact with Europe and did not realise what reaction the.’r Conference was having in Europe. Then they returned and found out how little impression they had made and how the general public in Europe believed that they were doing no good at all, the reaction against the League of Nations was something he was afraid of. He took as an example the chief French labour delegates, men of great influence in their own country, and leaders of the C. G. T. who, in spite of the strong opposition of the extremists of their party, had gone to Washington determined to do all that was possible to work in the spirit of the League of Nations. If, when they came back, they had to admit that, as the extremists had foretold, the Conference had been a failure, they 'would either run the risk of losing all thoir influence or would turn round against the League, This Conference might be, in fact, the first and last attempt at cooperation between Labour, employers and Governments, as opposed to the methods of the Internationale. The men in .'ashington did not realise that their work there was having no effect whatever in Europe. Ought wo net to enlighten them on the situation - net officially, of course - hut somehow convey tc them the necessity of either coming back with some cloar-cut result, or else putting the blame quite definitely on somebody. Tho system cf Cooperation v/as at stake, and Labour might be thrown bock on the Internationale.
Monsieur Cernert explained that he had heard from LIr .Sweets ey that the United qtatos Government refused wireless facilities to
newspaper/
newspapei correspondents, and gave their, only to the "bald official communique of the proceedings. He called attention to the statement in this morning’s Tints that it had "been said in the Senate that the Conference were ,Ta pack of Bolsheviks'’.
Sir Herbert Amos remarked that the United States Senate was now conducting a fight against organised labour, and that this reacted all over the world. Even where the system of cooperation v/n being tried, as in the Conference they were fighting it - as v/i one their attitude with regard to the financing of the Conference.
Monsieur Uonnot said that what mattered most was the impress ion made here. This first experiment in cooperation, unless it wo a conspicuous success world weaken the system of cooperation in general. It was essential to get some news across, 'whether in 1 form of speeches, letters, or personal notes abort those taking ra
The secretary General said that he agreed with what had been said, though the situation was perhaps not quite as black as it h . been painted. Ye were in danger of losing Labour support as regar dealing with labour questions. On other questions, 3uch as disarm ament, labour would still support the League. He suggested that Monsieur Monnet should draft something tc; send to Mr. Posdick on the lines proposed.
The question was raised, but not discussed, whether the Assembly, if it mot at iVashington, might find itself in similar difficulties.
Ur. Van Hamel suggested as a possibility that the labour Con ference might adjourn for a short period and reassemble in Europe, after publishing a full statement of what they had tried to do an^. what they had accomplished. It seemed wiser, however, not to suggest this to Mr. Fosdick now, but simply to state the situation as it appeared in Europe and leave it tv* those in Washington ti choose their own line of action.
Mr. Salter said that there was some prospect of an important
result/
result 'being- reached by the Conference, hut what was lacking ’■7as publicity.
Monsieur Hounet described the system nov; being set up by the French Government for their relations with the league. The permanent member of the Council, '..Ions i our Bourgeois, would have one principal assistant, who would reside regularly at the scat of the Image. They would have a Central Office in Paris under ..Ions lour Bourgeois, but in each Department would be one man specially told off to deal with the International Secretariat. Those officers would ’write direct to the corresponding official on the Secretariat through the Central Office.
Dr. Tan Parnell said that many other Governments would be interested to knew the procedure adopted by England and Franco. Perhaps, when officially settled it could be allowed to be generally known. 'Monsieur Monnet suggested that it might be announced at a Council meeting by one of the delegates and thus receive full publicity.
Hr. Salter said that he had received a cable from Hr. Fostick a week ago, sayir.g that there was good prospect of getting a settlement by agreement on the question of the eight chief industrial countries, and that he would cable again in about a week. He had not done so yet. If this hope were realised, it would bo a great gain. If it broke down, it might be necessary to bring the matter before the Council at its first, or an immediately subsequent,meeting.
Of the memorandum prepared in his section for the Assembly, the fullest and rest important part was that on currency. A really valu able collocti.cn of information on the state of the currency in dif -foment countries hod been made by a number of workers, blit this had been done in the expectation that the Assembly might meet at the end of "ovomber. If it ret several months later, the information would to ;> groat extent be out of date, and it would to necessary to consider the question of publishing this part of the memorandum, rather than lose the valuable work that had been done.
Fo remarked that the public in general anticipated that the
Council/
Council
would take in hand the Russian question, as one of the first tasks. He suggested that a legal opinion should h elaborated as to the position of the League with regard to Russia °ir Herbert ires said that the proofs of his draft budget had new arrived, He would circulate copies to Under Secretaries General and Directors.
He understood that if might he necessary for the League to advance funds for the work of the Saar Basin Commissions, Would this he rapaid before March 31? Mr- Colban said that the questio could not ho answered with certainty, hut it very well might ho sco
He asked whether funds would have to ho provided for (a) an International Currency Commission;
(tf a permanent Health body;
before March 31, The answer in each case was that those bodies could not come into existence until after the Assembly had met, so that, if any charge in respect of them came into the present financial year, it could only be at the very end of It and for a small sum.
Hr. Hit oho said that, foil wing the announcement in the Times that Japan had ratified the Treaty, and had made enquiries at the Japanese Embassy, and found that three days later the Ambassador had received official confirmation of the report.
It was agreed that, in view of tnis, Japan might now be asked to contribute her sharo on the xponses of the Secretariat, and that the same might be done in the case cf Brazil, whose ratification was reported in this morning’s
papers,

Captain Val ters.
1.	’The Secretary-General -said that it seemed likely that
the coning into force of the Treaty would be still further delayed. Captain Gilchrist had written a few days ago saying that it would probably not take place before December 1st. Since then he had seen an authority at the British War Office, who thought it would probably be delayed until December 15. The reasons given wore (l) the necessity of negotiating vith the Germans the protocol drawn up to ensure fulfilment of tho armistice conditions; and (g) the desire to know what the United States would do. The real reason probably was that the arrangements were not complote for the necessary despatch of troops.
The situation in the United States was far from clear.
Mr. Fosdick had written that the feeling against the President was very string.
g.	He referred to the communiqué from the Labour Conference
dated November Ibth, which stated that :,a resolution arising from spontaneous expression of opinion emanating from workers and employers alike called for the formation of a Health Section in the International Health Office". This to some extent clashed with the Health scheme which was now being prepared by the Secretariat, in which close cooperation with Labour was provided for. He proposed to cable to Mr. Butler suggesting that the resolution at the
Conference/
i

Conference should, take a form which recognised the existence of our plan for an International Health tody,
Sir Herbert fines remarked that this communique seemed to indicate the achievement of a great success won by cooperation, and in view of the recent failure of the Conference “between the United States employers and workers, this was a very striking fact.
The Secretary-General agreed, and said that he hoped it would he possible to get this achievement fully noticed in the Press, as also the very striking event of the reaching cf an agreement between Eastern and Western countries as regards child labour.
3.	Sir Herbert Ames said that the financial situation had
been very much cleared today by a letter from Hr. Butler, in which he said that the sum of 50,COO dollars already advanced by the League, together with the appropriation of 63,000 dollars voted by Congress, would probably cover the whole expenditure of the Con -ference end no further demand would probably be made.
He referred to the question of asking the British Dominions fo. their contributions. Ho thought that the legal position as regards Canada was quite clear. So far as Canada was concerned, the King had signed the Treaty under advice from the Canadian Executive, which in its turn had been sustained by a majority in Parliament.	It was decided that the financial posi-
tion should be carefully watched but that for the moment further action was unnecessary.
4.	Mr. Colban mentioned the position of the League with
reference to Eupen and ilalmedy, The President of the Peace Conference had sent a letter to the chief German delegate in which he seemed to consider that the League must take an interest in the expression of public opinion in those territories before the Belgian Government- m ide a report to the Council. It was hardly possible to overlook this expression of opinion, and he thought that probably the right course would be to present the correspondence to the Council without making any suggestion upon it, but with a roquet for instructions.
5.	D:.w (pi. to t;
-3-
5a	Dr. Uitnbe said that there were indications of a large
increase in the marcher of International Associations, particular! of financial ones. He had had an interview with Ur. Urgent Karri who, in collaboration particularly with Mr. Butterfield (17. S. A) wanted to develops the Institute of Agriculture at Rome, rcore especially in the direction >f derccoratising it. A march or of I: older Associations were, he thought, afraid to ask to cerce under the League before they knew just what doing so would rcean. They feared it right lead to a rear.oval of existing officials - for instance, the President of the Postal Union was, he thought, at present always a Swiss, and it right be thought that it would not be so in future under the League.
After a short discussion on the general relations between the League and International Bureaux, lionsieur ivlon.net stated that he had iust heard from Paris that the impression there was that the coming into force of the Treaty was almost sure to be delayed beyond the formerly expected date-- viz: November £7, - but that no date had yet been fixed.

Minutes of a Meeting held in the Secretary-G-eneral1 s Room, on .i'ednesday, 26th November,1919, at 3„30 p,m.
Present: -
The Secretary-General. Pr. Nitobe.
Sir Herbert Ames.
Mr. Golban.
Mr. ivlair.
Captain Walters.
1. The Secretary-General said that the chief point of interest was still the situation in the United states, The letters which he had received from Mr. Pcsdiok were very gloomy, and inclined to the view that the Treaty and the. League would be the points upon which the next Presidential election would turn, and that thus nothing could be finally settled before November 1920. This was not borne out by the views expressed by Mr. Polk, or the information sent from Washington
I by Lord Grey. They both expected a compromise - that is, if the President would ÿeld at all. The great danger lay in the fact that both sides seemed to think it a favourable ground to fight the election cn, His personal opinion was, that it wo¡Id be much better to have America in, even with at first very stiff reservations, than that she should stay out of the League altogether.
2« Coming into Porce of the Treaty. The Supreme Council's hope that I it would come into force on December 1st had not been recanted; but it was evidently hopeless. The impression in Government circles here was that it would not come into force before January 1st,
Mr, Mair said the."Morning Post” had published this date some days ago, and e.,plained that it was v/hat their correspondent had heard 1 in Paris,
The Secretary-General said there was something to be said for a fixed date, and one which made some appeal to the popular imagination, Mr Polk had definitely agreed that the President should summon the Council to meet tw© days after the coming into force of the Treaty. If the first Council meeting dir not take place before January 3, the
question/

question arose whether we ought to adhere to the strictly limited Agenda for the meeting or to think of extending it. On the whole, he was inclined to adhere to the existing plan, especially as it would be difficult, if it were decided to extend the Agenda, to settle what additional subjects should be brought in. The Council could, if they wished, discuss informally where the next meeting should be, and what Agenda it should take.
ff.r Go lb an agreed with this view. In particular, he thought it inadvisable for the Council to discuss the Saar Basin Governing Commission witnout having time to think it over first. Otherwise, we should be faced by majority decisions - which, though in theory valid, would in practice be disastrous.
On the question of publicity, the Secretary-General said that he hoped we should get the Council to agree beforehand to the admission of the press. Could we make out a good case in the Press for thus limiting the Agenda?
Mr Aair said he felt no doubt on this point. The League, as a democratic institution, must provide its own material to work on. He felt sure that we should have a cordial reception from the Press. The only difficulty he ever met with was the shortage of information to give them.
3„ She Secretary-General said that the Foreign Office had received a telegram, which he had not yet seen, from Switzerland, saying that the Swiss Government was most anxious to join the League as quickly as possible. ue did not know the reason for this, but thought It might possibly be due partly to an interview which he understood Monsieur Bourgeois had given to a Belgian newspaper man, in which he Said that the headquarters of the League would be at Brussels until Geneva was ready. The telegram said that the M/'iss Government had waived the stipulation that the referendum should he he held until the five Irincipal Allied an' Associated Powers hac5 ratified the Treaty.
He/
cf the meeting on the
Ho was anxious tc hear the views question of whether Brussels should he the Leaguo headquarters for about eighteen months or two years. During that pciiod, the working of the league would depend very much on the close coooeraticn of the Western powers. Dor all the Vestern capitals, Brussels was much more convenient that Geneva, while, for the more distant ones, the difference of a few hours either way was of no account. On the other side might be urged:
(1)	that it was hotter to get settled down where we meant to stay; and
'
(2)	that the more radicals elements, particularly in America, might say that this action showed the league to be a League cf victorious Allies, prom the practical point of view, he thought the gain outweighed the disadvantages„
Mr, Hair.said that for the Information Section, Brussels was greatly superior. Geneva went by Central European time, which was distinctly a handicap for dealing with America. In the United kingdom Brussels would bo more popular as a capital than Geneva.
The Secretary-General said that it was essential that it should be made perfectly clear that we were eventually going to Geneva.
Mr. Golban said that, as regards the ex-neutral powers, he thought that there would be no objection. Nor did he think it would hurt from the point of view uf the accession of Germany-.
Sir Herbert Ames said that from the American pwint of view he thought Geneva much the better, Over there they thought of Geneva as neutral, and of Brussels as being full of hats against the Central European Powers. Gould eventual German members of the Secretariat or a German delegation reside in Brussels?
The Secretary-General said that evidently no decision on the natter could be reached until it was certainly known what the United Stats3 could do. The question was raised as to whether the matter would have to re settled in the Council by unanimous vote, cr whether it oould bo treated as a matter of procedure.
Sir_ Herbert Ames. /
Sir Herbert Ames said that he feared ±t would be difficult,
cnee in Brussels, to leave it. The sane arguments as applied today would apply two years hence.
The Secretary-General thought that in two years the Leaguo would have greater drav/ing power than now. Communications, too, with Geneva would bo much better than at present, and the political centre of gravity would be shifted further eastward. Reference was made to the park and buildings which the Belgian Government had offered to the League. It appeared doubtful whether they would lend them for what was avowedly only a temporary occupation.
4.	As regards the Labour Conference, the Secretary-General said that reports agreed that this was going well, and the communiques had much improved, as the result of Monsieur Monnet’s telegram.
Mr. Mair said that since the improvement in the communiques very good publicity had boon given to the Conference* Even the "Laily Herald" had a leading article on it.
5.	ffiranoe. Sir Herbert Ames thought we could carry on until the Treaty came into force in January, if it should be postponed until then. He hoped that some of the letters recently sent out would preduoe seme results. He had received a bill drafted for the P'renoh. Parliament, providing for a part of the French Government’s contribution to tho Leaguo-,, but he did not know' whether it had been passed or not.
6»	Mr,. Hair said that Monsieur Comert was going to Brussels on
Saturday for the meeting of tho League of tin tic ns societies, such as "the League of Nations Union, etc.
7.
Mr. Cell an said that he had received confidentially
information that the Norwegian Government would postpone consideration of Norway’s joining tho League until January, Tho reasons for this he dod not know, but the; wore probably: (l) the attitude of the United States, and (2) tho postponement of the coming into force of the Treaty,
Some /
Seme discussion followed on the effect of the American
reservations, if passed, on other Powers, They would presumably have the right to reconsider their position, and to make reservations of their own. What would be the position of the thirteen invited States? The Secretary-General said that this was a nice point, because these thirteen States had to accede without- reservation, which was not strictly true of the signatories, file Chilian Government, in declaring its adhesion, reserved the right to consider any reservations mads by other members in joiugug the league. J.lo doubt other invited States would have the right to do the same. As regard the signatories, it appeared that those who had ratified without reservations could not now go back on that decision.
8.	Dr. Hitebe said that he had seen Admiral Sir J. Parry,
and also Sir William Collins. The former is taking steps to draft a Convention relating to the Hvdrographie Bureau. Ee intended to arrange an interview between Admiral Parry's representative and Dr. Van Eamel on his return. On the question of whether such a Convention ought to be nut forward by a Government, the_ Secretary-General expressed the oninion that this would most naturally ba done by the Government in whose capital it was fir at promoted - i,e,, in this case.

He nrac& hoped that one of the Council would, at its second or third meeting, urge the ecessity of seistin up the Commission and that the Council might perhaps instruct the ecret riat to produce a plan within, say, a week fro™ then but he did not want the Secretariat to initiate the proposal.

The Secretary*General said, as regards the coming!nto
force of the Peace Treaty, that he had nothing to report beyond what was, probably already known, viz. that owing to modifications wh-inin bar! hppn made in the protocol presented to the German Government for signature , the Germans seemed to oe likely to sign by the end of the week. M .Monnet, however, thought it would not be quite so soon.
As regards the First Meeting of the Council, the Presi-dent had left a certain amount, of latitude, auavi ^t would be necessary
jO avoid holding it exactly at Christmas time, and therefore if the
Germans signeHhis 'week, and the Treaty came into force immediately,

If the League gave protection, that protection was given by its various
•f—
members, and the League as such could not exercise sovereignty. Dr.

*
In reply to a question as to the meaning of Mr. Sonar Law's
TUm V Lu	Vloti: in the House of Commons reported in that morning 1 s
paper, viz. that the question which, if any, of the principal provisions of the Peace Treaty would be affected in the event of America not being a party to the League of Nations, could only be answered after careful investigation by legal experts, the Secretary-General said that, in his opinion, Mr. Bonar Law was referring to matters such as the constitution of commissions set up by the treaty, and that his answer did not mean that4 the British Government was con-sidering the question of going uTre of the League .
5.	Mr. Salter said he had attended the meetings of the Economic
Council at Rome. One thing oecame clear, namely that that Council now had very little power for the reason that it had no money at its disposal . It was discussed whether it should continue or come to an end, and it was decided that it should continue till January so that there should be no break between it and wwiovcr oody the League might set up to take its place. It could not, however, do anything important , and it was the unanimous view that if and when the League did set up a successor, the Economic Council should drop out entirely, except for one of its subsidiary bodies, namely the Consultative Food Committee . This is an executive body through which Allied purchases of food are made, and most of those present agreed that this work ought tS continue to be done entirely outside the League by a purely Allied body.

Of the special ^usbluuTJ discussed, the most urgent, apart from that of the Italian coal situation , was	TLUh,:-!, I nri n£ the
plight of Austria. The Economic Council reported that they could do nothing as long as they had no funds at their disposal. The
Supreme
Supreme Council regarded the Reparations Commission as responsible but the latter seemed to be vague as to its responsibility. The matter was now being discussed in Paris, and Dr, Renner was going there personally. While he (Mr. Salter) was in Paris, the Austrian Economic Delegate came to see him to find out whether the League could do anything to help them. He asked what Austria regarded as necessary to help towards a lasting solution of her extraordinarily difficult economic position, out to this the Delegate was frankly unable to reply. Her present need, of course, was for food and rav^iaterials . Her situation is appalling. Even on the rations which have been kept up this year over 80% of the children are suffering from diseases due to starvation. Those rations are now reduced, and there is every prospect of their being reduced still further.
After the meeting of the Economic Council, he had spent four or five days going thoroughly into the situation and organisation of the Institute of Agriculture. He was preparing a full
report which he would circulate when complete
»
c.
He then* visited
Paris in order to try and find out howfhr there was in existence
'EtA.M.
machinery for executing the economic parts of the^Treat^. For it was to be feared that odd jobs for which no one was responsible would devolve upon the League . Many problems were already arising out of the said economic provisions, as, for example, the question whether 3-epman customs duties , which by the Treaty are not to exceed tho:.e	in ljl- , could be levied at the pre-war value of the
mark, or the present value. This was a most difficult question.
He had been disturbed to find that there was no machinery to deal with such matters or to give advice to the Amoassa^rs'' Conference which would certainly require it.
*7	Tn a visit to the occupied territories of Lermany, he had
found both British and Americans were very anxious about ¿325. one
question^which they regarded as being of great importance for the future paace of Europe . This was the question of the introduction of black troops into a part of the occupied territory for which it was understood that arrangements are already oeing made.
The
3 *	The work prepared in the Economic and Finance Sections on
questions of currency ought, he thought, to be published, and this should be done in two languages - i .e , by a French firm, and by some such firm as Macmillan's, which was established both in Great Britain and in the United States . He would like to oe able to get on with the printing etc, so that the work might oe ready in canuary, and that, as it was purely objective in nature, there was little risk of the Council turning it down.
--------------- -f&>
(.The Secretary General thought that authority could begot
at the First Meeting of the Council, and that it would be fairly safe to get the work into proof-form.
M. Cpmert had one point to mention with regard to the Brussels Conference. It was there decided that there should oe a Union of League of Nations Associations with headquarters and a
secretariat. He would like to find a national of a neutral country
‘»'it	.■ ;
to be B -	of the Secretariat of this Union. Mr, B0i&an
asked whether this work could not be combined with Lr. Lange’s
position as Secretary of the Inter-Parliamentary Union which had its seat in Brussels. The Secretary-General thought that it would be very useful to combine the two , and Sir Herbert Ames expressed agreement with this, as Dr. Lange was a first-rate man and his Union worked on lines very similar to those proposed for the new organisation. Also, he was personally very much in sympathy with the League .
M. Comert referred to M. Clemenceau1s visit to London and thought that it was untrue that he was coming here to discuss the League of Nations or the situation with regard to Germany. He would be discussing chiefly economic questions . The Secretary General thought the same, but the question of the League might come in indirectly .

1. The Secretary-General said that the coming into force of the Peace Treaty seemed at last to be in sight, and would probably take place before or on -January 1. President ..ilson would probably call the first mooting of the Council for about seven days later. M Comert said that this notice wo■Id enable his section to make all necessary arrangements.
£-. The United___states situation. Sweetser had telegraphed on the
13th in a fairly hopeful tone. That, however, was before the announce' mcnt from the white House that the President was not prepared to compromise,.
?. The question of whether the oecretariat shoui. go temporarily to Brussels was much affected by the decision of the United btates. If the J.b. were going to join whole-heartedly in the League and make the Council its channel for dealing with international affairs, it would be safe to go straight to Ueneva, because the cooperation of the United states was so necessary to Muropean countries that their leaders would go to whatever '.•'lace they would find a plenipotentiary of the United States.	If,however, she did not join, or joined enly in
name, the league would have to re ly mainly on the ..osteon lowers. A meeting such as that which had just taken place between Mr. Lloyd aeorge and Monsieur Clemenceau in London could hardly he hoped for at Ueneva. If the League were there, it would probably be ignored, and the Prime Ministers would meet in Paris or London. They would however, he thought, be v/illin.-- to go to Brussels, The matter, there--
therefore!, could net to settled until the decision of the. United States was known. Colonel House was very strongly opposed to a temporary headquarter3 at Brussels. A factor which right make an early settlement necessary was that of the labour Organisation. Ho had not had an opportunity of discussing with anyone returned from Washington which place would be tho botter from their point of view. The British Trades Union people seemed to bo strongly in favour of Brussels.
4.. Tho Assistant Librarian, Hiss Uilson, had now arrived. There was sore question as to what system of cataloguing should be adopted. Miss Uilson was strongly in favour of the "Congress” system, but the greater part of the big Uuropcan Libraries have adopted the "Dewey” aystom. If we finally decided to treat the Institut International de Bibliographie at Brussels as tho general cataloguing organisation of tho League and to pay a subvention to it accordingly, wo might perhaps find that wo ought to adhere to the same method which they used. Miss Wilson was now about to visit that Institute at Brussels and also the Law Library at the Hague.
5; Dr, van Hamel raised a general principle in connection with tho plans for the Transit Commission. The «chôme for this organisation, as for that on health and perhaps tho future economic organisation etc., wore all moro or less copies of the Labour part of the Treaty, with a permanent body and periodical conferences. He questioned whether this was not a somewhat top-heavy arrangement in the case *f institutions whose subject-matter was comparatively unimportant fr#m a political point of view. He did not like tho idea of large Con-ferenoos on technical subjeots voting on the previsions of draft conventions submitted t© them.
Hr. Saltor said that tho idea had occurred to him also. There Wore two aspects in particular that ought to be considered:-1. In the oa3e of the- Institute of- Agrioultu.ru there was a permanent Committee residing away from its own country and detached from the Governmental Departments dealing with tho same subject-matter, while its members were well-known experts and had not enough to do. This was a bad example.
In/
In parallel c-..Joa some arrangement should k fix. do by which members of the permanent Cor® it tec would servo pert of their time at home.
2.	"as it necessary to call an assembly of all nations for work such as the- Transit Commission would bo dealing with? Gould not a sufficient universality of representation bo got:
(a)	by changing the members of the permanent Committee;
(b)	by convening ad hoc Conferences on the initiative either of the permanent Committee or of a certain proportion of its members.
The- Secretary-General said that he agreed with much that had boon said. One could not treat all these proposed institutions on the same linos. Hor instance, while the proposed Health Organisation followed the labour plan fairly closely, with regard to Transit an important difference was contemplated - viz: that the Secretariat of the Transit Commission would be aotually members of mhe International Secretariat of the league. He mentioned in this connection that the Labour officials wore thinking of using the services of the general sections of the International Secretariat - e.g., those dealing with law, finance, information. His view in general was that it was host to let such organisations develop autonomously but keep in relationship more or loss close with the Secretariat.
6.	Hr. Salter said that the greatest danger which the League had to face was, that when the Council began to meet, they would fail to hold real discussions such as those recently held in London. He had heard reports of a proposed development of the Versailles Secretariat as the Secretariat of further meetings of the same kind. He hoped that these reports were based on a misapprehension of the proposals to extend the existence of the Versailles flilitary Council.
7.	The question was discussed as to whether it might be desirable, when the Treaty had come into force, for representatives of the League to go to America (on the invitation of th-j Senate) to present the case from the point of view of Europe. Some such idea was supported by Dr. van Hamel and Sir Herbert Amos, and was opposed by the
Secretary-General/
-4-
Secretary-Genoral, LIr. Colban and Captain Gilchrist.
6. Sir Herbert j-jmoa said that he would vary scon need some more money.
It was decided that, if any new event of importance occurred, such as the fixing of che date of the coming into fcrce of the Treaty, the next meeting should be hold on Monday, December 2£. Otherwise, it should bo postponed until the following week.

1.	The Secretary-General said that in the opinion of the French Foreign Office, the most probable date for the coming into force of the Treaty was January 10th. The first Meeting of the Council would follow seven or eight days later. Ashed as to what interval he anticipated would occur between the first Meeting and the next one, he thought that this would depend on the attitude of the senate. If there was a chance of a representative of the United States being present later, the second meeting would naturally be postponed till be could attend it. The first Meeting would deal with the appointment of the Same basin Delimitation Coromission only; perhaps the necessary permission to publish the work cn currency prepared by the Economic and Financial Section could be got uno 'ficially at the same Meeting, or it might be got simply from the President of the Meeting, Thereafter he hoped to have net an isolated meeting, but a Session lasting four or five day^at least, at a hick much necessary business could be cleared off.

The Secretary-General said that, ho hoped that the coming inti force of the Treaty had at last been definitely fixed for Saturday or idonday next. Information received after the Meeting confirmed this.
On the point of publicity he thought we ought to be a little careful that the attention of the Press and public should not fall too much on the Secretariat, which might, to some extent, be expected tc be the object of jealousy on the part of Government Departments. This could not be tru e of the Council, and it was on the Council that publicity should mainly fall. In particular the members of the Secretariat would be wiser not to express any opinion in conversation with newspaper men etc., on the subject of the Seat of the League. It would be best to take the line that Geneva was named in the Covenant and that we had no knowledge respecting any alteration in this.
Mr. Salter said that the American situation on its economic side had recently taken a serious turn for the worse. The United states secretary tc the Treasury had, about a fortnight ago put forward excellent proposals about the extension of credits to Durope. Since then the nearst Press had been writing with great hostility about Europe's desire to borrow, and some very unfortunate speeches had been made by Sir George Paish who had used very exaggerate- figure and by his statement had strengthened the case for the ilearst Press
and had '
o
— ¿L —
and had pushed Mr. Hoover into a more critical attitude than he would naturally have taken.
A part of his lection's work on currency Questions was now in the Press; it was being printed both in French and English.
Monsieur Comert in reply to a question, said he did not contemplate publishing the first number of the Official Gazette immediately, but waiting until about a month before the first Assembly. He thought the first number would have to give some account of the secretariat and of events up to the first Council Meeting, and it would be difficult to publish this before the Council had confirmed the oecretary-General1s appointments and before it was known whether America was in the League or not.
This had been the plan agreed on by the small Committee which had discussed the question in August last. The ecretary-Gencral said he had thought that the first number would consist merely of a record of the first Meeting of the Council. Another number could come out if it became necessary to publish a Treaty.
hr. Van Hamel thought it would be better to publish Treaties separately, perhaps in a special supplement to the Gazette.
Monsieur Moimet said it must be decided whether the Gazette was to be merely the official record of the Acts oF the League or should aim at being a production of interest in itself. He thought it should be the former und should contain the authentic text of all documents regarding Official acts of the league. If this view were right, it should be published at once after the Council met an contain the official record of the decisions of the Meeting when later on the Council considered the appointments to the lecre-tariat, the Gazette would automatically contain all information on that subject.
The oecretary-General said he thought this was the right view, but that in that case we must abandon any idea of its helping from the point of view of publicity; it would not appeal to the general public.
After some further discussion, it was generally agreed that the first number ought to come out immediately after the first
Meeting/
Meeting of thw Council; and that Treaties could he published in a specially numbered series of the Gazette.
It was thought that the first number might contain the Covenant, list ftf the States which h?' i already ratified or acceded and a formal reoord of the first Council Meeting.
The further question was raised whether only official documents should be published or whether articles of international interest might come in as vieil, as, for instance, in the Board of Trade Journal, which exists primarily to convey official information, but also contains various articles on commercial subjects. There was much matter of international interest which ought to be published in a more authoritative manner than could be done by inserting it in the ordinary Press. It was also suggested that documents circulated to the Council for their information and not fcr their decision thereby became official and could be published as such. The Secretary-General said he was clear that we should begin by publishing official documents pnly and perhaps proceed to produce a semi-official Journal a little later on.
Sir Herbert Ames handed round a statement of the financial situation of the Secretariat, the conclusion from, which was, that we must have sore more money. Gur over-draft now amounted to ¿19,000; by the end of January it would be ¿£5,000, ; nd our limit was ¿35,000.
Our payment fcr the labour Conference amounted to ¿lb,000. Monsieur ’donnet said he hopes soon to get a further contribution from the French Government.
Sir Herbert Amos said tfcct the Budgetary period was arranged 1-st September to end on March 21st in order to square with the financial year of the British Government. He now questioned whether it would not be wiser to make our fin. ncial year agree with that in use on the Continent, i.e. the calendar year. Je might perhaps make our first period gc on to the end of June next and regard it as a half year. Those ten States to which letters have teen sent asking for contributions based on the former calculations, could be informed that owing to the delay in the coming into force of the Treaty, the
e.mount calculated to last up to March 31st would not be expended before/
-4-
before June 30th. Tho Secretary-General thought it would be less oren to criticisr to hold to our present calculation and to rake our next financial neriod one of nine norths, i-e. up to Gecerrher 31st, 1920.

The Secrotary-General said that he thought that on the whole
the Paris Council meeting had been n success, and that it was held in a favourable atmosphere, certainly as far as the French government was concerned. The one valid criticism which he had hoard was that the only question discussed was the appointment of the Saar Valley Delimitation Commission. This of course had all been arranged in advance, and no other course was possible in tho circumstances.
It was clear, however, that tho next mooting must dc real business.
It had been loft tc Monsieur Bourgeois, in consultation with the Secretary-General, to decide on the agenda for the next Council mooting. Seven subjects which needed early consideration had already been chosen, and an eighth might also be placed on tho list. This last was with regard to Swiss neutrality and Swiss membership on the League of Kati ns. Thitj/qu aticn had boon discussed by the Supreme Council, and that body had at first asked for a report on the question from the Council ;,f the League of Nations. The Secretary-General had protested because such action by the Supreme Council placed the Council of the League of Nations in an impossible position. It was then apparently decided by the Supreme Council to refer the question to the Council of the League of Nations for action.
Since then the Council of Ambassadors in Paris had, it seemed, given further consideration to this question, and the real situation
was not/
wa§ not clear. It was apparent, however, that Ambassadors, acting in ihe name of their own governments, could not hind other countries. Even a decision by the Council of the League of Nations would probably bind only governments which had members on the Council.
Everyone appeared willing to meet reasonable Swiss views. The problem involved two questions:
(l) If Switzerland becomes a member, will she bo able to maintain her neutrality as recognised in 1815?
(£) Will there be a right of passage for the troops
of the League across Switzerland if she joins the League?
Lr. Van Hamel had suggested an ingenious solution, i.e.,
that there should bo no right of passage exceot with the consent
of Switzerland. The Secrtary-General believed that this ought
to satisfy all parties.
The Secret ary-Gen oral said that the second meeting will
probably be held ¿n February 11. According tc present plans, the
first half-hour would be an open session. The Chairman would be
chosen and the agenda announced. The Chairman would then say that
in view of the fact that it was imoossible to discuss names ana
personal matters in public, the Council found it necessary to go
into secret session, but that no agreements made at any secret meeting
would be valid until confirmed in public. The Secretary-General hoped
that this plan of procedure would be followed, and he understood
that Monsieur Bourgeois had agreed in general to this programme.
Monoieur Bourgeois had advocated the "rapporteur" system
for bringing up questions in the Council meeting, i.e., each
Council member would bring up a separate question in accordance a
with pre-arranged schedule. This plan seemed quite ingenious.
A
It would interest all the members of the Council and would relieve
I
the Chairman considerably.
Sir Herbert Amos asked what police-4Jxould be followed with reference to the attendance of Directors t Council meetings.
The Secretory-Genoral said that ho hoped they would be present, although ho thought that only those members of the Secretariat directly interested in the questions under consideration should occupy places at the Secretariat table.

The Secretary-General reported that the Japanese Ambassador had socr1 him to-day and that he expected to be able to transmit Jo.pairs financial contribution tc the Secretariat in a very short time .
The Sec ret ary-General announced that Monsieur Thomas had been unanimously elected Permanent Director of the International Labour Office. He said that there was a plan under consideration for the appointment of two Vice-Presidents for the Soverning Body of the Labour Organization, Under this scheme the three categories, governments, employers and employees, vw uld each he reoresented either by a President or a Vice-President, and the Presidency w-uld be held in turn by each f these three groups.
Mr. Hair asxed how su advance inf.-rmatian with regard t< the second Council meeting should be given t the press.
The Secretary-General said that the invitations had n>t yet been^ent out, but that they were gc ing shortly, and that	first
ann uncements t- the press could probably be made by the end cf the week.
Mr. Mair announced that the prrfs for the first number f the Official Journal w uld probably he ready to-day.
Caotain Gilchrist said that the draft Labour Conventions and Recommendations, and formal notices about the closing cf the Washington Labour Conference were almost ready t; £'■ out to the States concerned.
The Secretary-Seneral suggested that Monsieur ^aelbroeCk: might draw up a notice about this to be inserted in the Official Journal.
dir Herbert Ames asked to what extent the Council of Ambassadors replaced the old duprerre Council in Paris.
The decretary-loneral said that the new Council of Ambassa-foxs was supposed to sit for questions arising in connection with the execution of the Treaty only. He noticed, however, that questions quite outside this field had already been referred to that body.

The Secretary-General spoke of the propose! procedure for the next aession of the Council. He had outlined at the last meeting the general plan, viz. that it should begin with an open meeting, to he followed by a closed session. The decisions to be taken at olesed meetings were, however, to be regarded as provisional.
Monsieur Bourgeois had accepted this suggestion; the Eritish Government he believed would also agree to it, but of this he hoped to have certain information that evening. The Italian representati^o, and In fact the other members in general might, he hoped, be confidently expected to agree. The first (open) meeting would be held at noon on the 11th February, and might last half to three-quarters of an hour. In the afternoon there would be a closed meeting, and he hoped the question of Swiss Neutrality would then be taken up.
He had telegraphed to the Swiss Government, saying that he felt sure that the Council would welcome Swiss representatives if they oared to come to state their case. It would probably be discussed by the Council on the afternoon of the 11th February. On the l£th February there would be two closed meetings, at which unanimity would, he hoped, be got for the names of the persons who were to be appointed to the Sarre Governmont Commission, to Danzig, and to the Committee for the International Court. On the 13th February these and other questions would be presented in public session by the various rapporteurs, and decisions would be taken in public.
The fact that the Russian question had teen raised at the meeting of the Governing Body of the International Labour organisation might mean that it would he brought to the attention of the Council shortly. For its diaoussion there would need to be a specially called, meeting. His view was that any member could call such a speoial meeting at any time.
Monsieur de Fleuriau had been to see him, and had unofficially communicated the views of the French Government on the Sarro Governing Commission. These seemed to him, as regards the nationalities suggested, to be most excellent from the point of view of the League.
Dr. Nitobe said he had received a letter from Sir William Collins on the subject of the Opium Traffic, and wanted to know whether the League of Nations was going to take any action on this sub ject.
The Secretary-General said the question had been raised in Paris, and efforts had been made to get the Opium Convention ratified as soon as possible by every country. He thought it possible that if some countries did not do so, those who had might well bring the question up at the Assembly.
Dr. van Hamel remarked that those states which probably would not have ratified when the Assembly met were likely to be just these who were not members of the Assembly, e.g. Afghanistan. After some discussion a suggestion was made, and met with general approval, that an honorary oommittee of persons such as Sir William Collins and Monsieur Grande might be brought into existence to watch the execution of the Convention, and one member of the Secretariat coaid be specially detailed to work with that Oommittee. Suoh member might, perhaps, best be of Dutch nationality, because the Dutch Government had always taken the lead in promoting the settlement of the Opium problem. Meanwhile a temporising reply should be sent to Sir William Collins.
Dr. van Hamel said that with reference to the procedure for the Council Meeting, we should avoid speaking of decisions being made at closed meetings and confirmed at public ones. It would be better
to ¿.peak/
-3-
to speak of the oonolesions reached at closed meetings taking the form of decisions or resolutions at public meetings*
He asked whether the Armaments Commission would figure on the Agenda of the nekt Council Meeting, and urged that on grounds of public opinion some-fairly definite step ought to be taken, e.g. the Council should instruct the Secretary-General to prepare for its next session a plan for the Commission.
The Secretary-General while agreeing with the view that the question ought to be dealt with as soon as possible, said he felt sure that the right moment had not yet oome for the Secretariat to make a move, which should not be done until the Governments had indicated some readiness to act.
Dr. van Hamel mentioned that he had heard in Paris of a number of amendments to the proposed order of procedure. He thought there was a likelihood of a long debate on this question. Ike view was generally expressed that such debate would be a good thing as giving the members opportunity to discuss as members of a special body, and not as representatives of their Governments.
Monsieur Varies spoke of the lisoussion which had taken place in the meeting of the labour Governing Body on the proposal to send a commission to Russia. Ibis had been warmly supported at the moating, particularly by the Workers1 Delegates. Finally it had been decided that Monsieur Thomas should report to the next meeting of the Governing Body on the 22nd March.
The Secretary-General thought this was a good thing, and would force the Governments to consider1 their policy in Russia.
Mr, Lloyi said in this connection that the Supreme Economic Council would meet on Friday and Saturday next, and would discuss the question of Russia from an economio point of view. Possibly they would refer the question to the League, Would this be advisable? It would probably take the form of a resolution to the effect that the League of Nations ought to carry to a further degree the policy of the Supreme Economio Council in authorising exchange of commodities between oo-operativa societies within and 'without Russia.
He need not say how important it was from the point of view ef tha
food/
food situation in Europe that the exportable supplies in Russia should he pot at.
The Secretary-General thought that everything tended to show that there must he a speoial meeting of the Council to deal with Russia within eh out th::eo weeks. He did not want speoial reference to he made beforehand to economic or labour conditions on which information was desired, for this might lead to the sending out of a technical commission instead of to the despatch of a commission of politically important and responsible persons,, which he hoped might be decided upon.
Mr. Lloyd referred to the plan of the Oommunications Seotion of the Supreme Economic Council to summon a oonferenoe of postal and telegraphic experts. Should an effort be made to haYe this conference summoned under the auspices of the League, the Secretary-General said he thought it better to let the Communications Section go ahead if their plan woald not olash with the Transit Commission now sitting in Paris. Mr. Lloyd promised to talk to General Manoe on the subject.
Mr. Lloyd said the European Coal Commission had passed a resolution saying that they ought to oome under the League. He thought on the other hand that they should oome under the Supreme Economic Council, but this depended to some extent on the relationship to be established between the Supreme Economic Council and the League of Nations.
M, Colban said with reference to the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League, that he waa in touch with the Belgian representative, and hoped soon to be in touch with the Greek representative.
M. Mantoux referred to the report in a telegram from Lord Aoton of the intention to hold a Baltic Conference. The Conference might be composed on two principles:-
(1)	it might be called by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers who would invite the interested States to send representatives.
(2)	it might be a Conference called by the League of Nations.
(1)	he thought would be a bad precedent, and he suggested that the matter might he watched, and if necessary it should be pointed out that the questions with which suoh a conference would deal were lust
of th'. /
of the kind for which the League was created.
[The Seoretary-General said that he had disoovered that Lord Acton's message, as it reaohed us, had not been accurately reported. Ihe proposal referred to had been put forward at the Baltic» Conference but had received so far no support from the Principal Allied and Associated Powers. He had also written to Mr. Balfour urging that this was essentially a matter to be dealt with by the League.

The Secretary-General said that there was very little to
repo1. A as all the Lire;	;tors had attended the Council meetings, and
would receive copies of	the prooes verbal giving a full account of
the private as well a.* 1	;he public meetings,. The Council members had
met entirely by themselves in order to discuss names in connection with appointments, hut there was absolute harmony and there had really been nothing to discuss a Thanks in large part to the work of preparation done by Mr . Co loan and Dr* Van Ilamel. the meetings went off successfully and smoothly*
As to the Financial Conference, the Secretary General had
at first been somewhat :	reluctant about calling it, as he could not
see how it could arrive	at any solution of the problem* It has now
been summoned, however,	and received good press notices* In all
probability it would be	held some time before May, It was his plan
to form an organising committee which would pretty well prepare the programme for the conference. The chief countries concerned would be represented on this committee and an attempt would be made to balance properly the debtor and creditor countries. The composition and work of this organising committee would count almost more than anything else, An attempt was being made to attach to the Economic Section of the League a financial expert who would act as chairman
of the/
would probably not be necessary to
of the organising committee, attach the other members of the committee to the Economic Section of the Secretariat,
The Secretary-General, however^. was not following all the arrangements for this organizing committee, as he had requested Monsivur Monnet to take charge of this matter,
The next meeting of the League Council would be held in Rome, as was announced, and in all probability it would occur during Easter week.. This could only gire barely a month in which to finish the work, connected with the London meeting and to get ready for the new agenda which would probably comprise:
(1)	Armaments Commission a
(2)	Prisoners in Russia and Siberia (which may involve
negotiations with the Soviet government),
(3)	Organization of an Ecohomic and Financial Section of
the League (to replace the old Supreme Econ'mio Counc il7.
(4)	Commission to Russia. (The Governing Body of the
Labour Conference had considered sending a technical commission to Russia., but so far nothing had been heard officially from Monsieur Thomas shout this.)
(5)	Budget of the Secretariat,
(S) Organization of the Secretariat,
(7)	Plan for the registration of treaties. (Although not
necessary to submit this to the Council, it seems advisable to get their opinion,)
(8)	Procedure of the Council- (This has been practically
agreed upon by a committee consisting of Ml» Ferraris, Fleuriau, Spicer and Van Hamel,)
(9)	Statistics. (The plan is to set up a statistical
committee similar to that created to form plans for the International Court of Justice,)
The Secretary-General especially desired to get the opinion of the meeting on two problems:
(l) Disposition of document from Commandant at Fiume.
A paper had been addressed to the Secretary-General by the Commandant at Fiume. This was in the nature of a tirade against the League similar to the letter distributed at the Paris meeting of the Council by the representatives of the Irish Republic, He was in doubt as to whether this should be circulated to the Council o:: not.
Monsieur Colban /
Monsieur Corban was cf the
opinion that this Plight be
circulated later if at any time the Council was called upon to deal
with the Pxume question, but that
the paper did not represent the
settled opinion of anyone and should not be seriously considered He cited the, case of similar papers sent to the League sometime ag > by people m Alsace-Lorraine who objected to its annexation to Fran
Nothing had been done with these papers.
The Bee re tary-General said that the Fiume question was
now under discussion by the Peace Conference and that it might
therefore be advisable to If any action were to be taken to take it
at once. Perhaps the Council of the League should be informed of
was
the Document, lie noted that the document./apparently signed by the responsible authorities of Plume and he asked Commandâtore Anzilott how much weight should be attached to these names.
Commandât ore Anzilott! said that the Commandant of Frame could speak for the inhabitants of the city, but not for the
inhabitants of the .-ioinity.
The Secretary-General suggested that the document might be sent to the Supreme' Council»
It was generally agreed that if it were found that the paper could really bo said, to express the opinion of a considerable part of the population of Fiume, it should be sent to the Supreme Council, and also to the members of the Council of the League.
The latter would be notified of the transmission of the document
to the Supreme Council
The Secret a y- General also decided that nothing should be done with the Alsace-Lorraine papers.. That was a closed case,, The Fiume one was still unsettled.
Sir Herbert Ames suggested that it was inadvisable to be caught with such papers at a public meeting, because he noted that the American press gave more prominent space to the circulation of the Irish petition at the first Council meeting than to anything else which happened there,
(2) General plan/
• - ■ j: “ *
f £)_C-k nexal plan for Library.
_Secx6tary-Qeroral said that it was his original idea
to ¿ippoint a scholar as xhief librarian, and he had hoped to obtain a Pole for this position* He did not think there was any need for haste about this, however, as the library could not be greatly expanded until we reached Geneva» Meanwhile he had appointed Miss Wilson as Assistant librarian„ She had the expert knowledge required to manage a library. She wanted two assistants trained in American library methods„ She considered that the American library system was in advance of the system in mes b .'tier countries, She had begun to inaugurate the American system and she oould therefore only look for real assistance from American oersonnel. He was inclined to agree with her plan. If this were adopted, he would have to consider, as Sir Herbert Ames had suggested, whether a Chief Librarian would net then bo superfluous. There seemed much question about this. If a scholar were appointed as chief, he would probably be tempted to interfere with the system in operation if that did
not entirely meet with his fancy or app vaL
])r, Hitobe said that the Library Committee had discussed this question at its last meeting, and that they had agreed with Miss Wilson1a program. The question as to the appointment of a Chief Librarian had not, however, been discussed, although he could not see that such an official would really be necessary.
Monsieur Comert thought that at the end of à no:
un en
the library had e nanded considerably, a Chief Librarian might be required.
Sir Herbert Ames pointed oat that library management was really a profession; that there were various systems, and that it was just as impossible to manage a library by combining three or four systems as it would be to do business with three ox four types of bookkeeping* If you dod not concentrate on one system, there would be altogether too much discussion as to the best method of work, and you would not get results. Miss Wilson had been asked
to come over and her system had been accepted. She needed assistants
and he/
-5
and he thought it desirable to appoint the two Americans whom she desired. This would enable her to set up a trailing school and no more Americans would be required.
Monsieur Varies believed that the League library should be able to afford opportunity for extended research, and that the system of management and classification should he carefully studied. The Secretary-General explained that Miss Wilson had examined the various systems of management and classification employed in thr large libraries of Europe, and that there was no doubt of the value of the Dewey Decimal Classification System which was to be adopted here, He was not clear, however, whether it would be advisable to build up a large research library or only to establish a practical working library.. He was inclined to favour the second plan,
Dr Van Hamel said that the League should be a headquarters for practical people and not for students, and that a scholar would really not be needed at the bead of the library.
Sir Her be- t Ames agreed, saying that the League needed a working machine. He noted that nine-tenths of the hooks in most libraries were usually out-of-date and not used.
Mr. Colban said that, as an example, the library should contain a complete collection of works on ethnological question. The library should have someone on the staff skilled in this particular field, to work in collaboration with his Section,
Captain Gilchrist said that ho thought that Miss Wilson and her staff would b able to handle work of this kind.
It was the general consensus of opinion that the two American assistants should be appointed.
Mr, Baker pointed out that the library of the League should be unique in many ways, having collections of works on international subjects more complete than could be found elsewhere, The Secretary-General said that we should collect those books which were needed in our work, but he did not think it advisable to try to collect all bocks published, that is, to collect merely for the sake of eoll.eeting.
Mr. Colban noted that we should form a library with boons
which might/
-6-
which might bo required by the Council mombers as well as by the Secretariat.
Commandat ore Anzllotti said that ho knew how difficult it was to organize the library. He mentioned the necessity for maintaining satisfactory connections with the various Sections and with the different countries of the world. There was of course the problem «f space, too, for so far the league library was only very rudimentary.
Mr. C«Iban spoke about a request from the Lanish Legation for information desired by the government in Copenhagen with regard tc the organization of.!, the Secretariat, its system of work and the appointments made, He had replied that ho official information could be given at present, but that certain information could be obtained from articles already printed in the daily press. He had been asked to collect these articles from the Press for the Legation, but of course this could not very well be done. He believed that this was an unfortunate situation, as he thjught that the various governments should be able to defend and explain in their parliaments the organization of the Secretariat. He realized the difficulties, however, in giving publicity regarding apocintments.
The Secretary-General said that we could distinguish between questions of organization and questions of personnel.
The plan of organization of the Secretariat was not under the Covenant any concern of tho Council. Information could be given out about that, but names of persons appointed to various posts should not be given.
Sir Herbert Amos called attention to a letter from Mr.
Sweetser in which he stated that he had signed a contract with the Pew York Eost to write a series c-f Articles, including one of the Secretariat.
The Secretary-Goneral said that he had cabled tc Mr.
Sweetser requesting him to be very cautious about this article.
Sir Herbert Amos announced that an article cn the Secretariat
for the/
for the North Amorloan Review had been prepared by kr. kair and himself. This was ready to .go to America for publication ar a, later date .
Monsieur Me met said that he thought it very important in writing a Loirs the various Sections of the Secretariat to avoid creating the impression that the Section of the Secretariat was the only body to deal for the league with questions coming within its natural scope» .fie noted specifically the existence of a Transit Section in the Secretariat, and also the Commission of Enquiry, on Transit in Paris., Ke thought it very important that we should not lay too.much emphasis upon the Secretariat Sections. Monsieur Monnet's view was generally approved.

Monsieur Colban,
Monsieur Comert,
Ur. van Hamel,
Dr. Nitobo,
Captain Gilchrist,
Mr. v/alters.
The Secretary General said that, the league was faced &t the moment with two tasks of special importance.
1)	The Economic Conference; as regards tais, preparatory
measures were now being taken. Progress in them had not been
quick because we had failed to secure the man we had hoped for
as Chairman of the Organisation Committee. It now seemed to be
the best plan not to have an Organisation Committee's such, but
to keep this work in the hands of the Economic and Financial
Section of the Secretariat. ( In this connection he informed
the Meeting that Mr. Layton had accepted the position of Director .
of the Economic and Financial Section, trough he would not be
able to give his whole time to the work until the end of March,
The Secretary General felt sure that Mr. Layton v,»s far the best
man thnt could possibly be found for the post. ) Monsieur
Monnet had consented to do the work for the time, and it was planned
to set up an Advisory Committee. This decision had only been
reached yesterday, and the personnel of the Committee was not
quite fixed. The general lines on which it was planned were as
follows:- it should include representatives of Italy, France and
Great Britain, nnd of two ex-ileutral countries, perhaps Holland
and Spain. It should i^repaie the programme for the Conference,
and decide which were the countries who were specially interested
and ought to be invited to send representatives. The present
that the Conference should take place at Brussels,and as
regards;
idea was
-2-
regaids the dr te, that it should he in April, probably the latter half of the month.
2)	The Russian Commission. The Press had contained a notice of the task which the Supreme Council had asked the Council of ohe league to undertake. He felt that the Council could hardly refuse this invitation, especially since, as Dr. van Hamel's memorandum had shewn, it was legally its duty to take up the Russian question. He had been talking on the matter to Jar. Balfour, who said that if it met with general approval, there might be a special meeting of the Council on or about the 10th March in Paris. He had hoped that it could have been earlier, but if so, it would be difficult to have everything ready in time. If the 10th March suited Monsieur Bourgeois, he v/ould issue a notice the next day.
It was possible that this extra Council Meeting might have
the effect of postponing the Meeting at Home for a week.
He
intended to consult the Italian Member of the Council on this point. A week's delay would give a bit more time to get through the work involved by the Russian affair.
At the last Meeting of the Council, he had ventured to suggest that to hold the next Meeting at Rome might be an expensive matter. oT.ce than he had received a memorandum in which the cost was worked out at £2,000. However, the Council had authorised the Meeting being hexd at Rome in spite of his suggestion, so the matter need not be re-opened.
One other/
One other natter might be dealt with at the Paris Meeting.
Hr. Balfour intended to send on his own initiative on appeal to the League of Bed Cross Societies to take the lead in voluntary efforts for economic relief in Central end Eastern Europe. This was an action which no one was likely to question, but he might like tc get his action formally confirmed by the Council, Tt was also possible that some announcement might be made about the
Economic Conference-
4
"r. van Hamel mentioned that he end Dr. Kitobe had had an interesting meeting with Dr. Lange. He wondered if there were no way in which the Secretariat could keep in permanent touch with such men as he, A oossible plan would be to form a voluntary advisory committee of such men, which could meet from time to time and keep each other and the League informed with regard to the various movements with which they ware concerned. Dr. Lange had not seemed very enthusiastic regarding the suggestion that he should act with the International Secretariat of the League of nations Union.
Captain Gilchrist said that Miss Y/ilson had recently told him that in cases where Directors or others intended to work on special subiects, it would be useful if she could have as long notice of the fact as possible in order to give her time to start collecting the necessary books etc.

The Secretary-General said that the only fear that he had at present was that the League might have in the next three or four months more work than it could do. The preparations for the Exchange Conference were going ahead well when the Supreme Counoil at Downing Street began to discuss the same matters. They had gone, he understood, a long way, hut only as regards the Allies, They might lay down general principles somewhat on the lines of the Glass letter and make proposals as regards Allied countries.
In this case the main scope of the League Conference would he to co-ordinate their views with those of the nations previously neutral. The small Advisory Committee on which Layton, Avenol,
Ter Meulen, Dudloy-’Vard, and Brand have consented to serve and to which he hoped an Italian would he added, would meet next Monday and draw up a list of countries who should he invited, to send delegates to act as members of the Conference, and a second list of those who should he invited to send delegates to he present when questions specially affecting them are considered. He hoped the invitations would he sent out next week,
As to Russia, he hoped with Monsieur Ilantoux's help to he able to circulate almost immediately to the Council a suggestion as to how the Commission should he constituted. The idea was now generally favoured that the Council should nominate all members of the Commission except the two to be nominated by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, who would represent Employers and Workmen respoctivcly. It would bo necessary also to set up a small organising Committee which would have much work to do in
reapeou/
-2-
respect of transport, exchange, communications, oto. It was proposed to form a small tody for these questions, which for the present v/ould "be attached to the Secretariat hero, and eventually to go out to Russia with the Commission.
The Supreme Council might perhaps ask us to take up the question of armaments as soon as possible. This information should he regarded as confidential for the present. The question was of course already on our agenda foi Rome,
The Paris Meeting had "been summoned for the 12th March; it
to travel	cn 1	,he 10th March, He	questioned
o possiblo	to 1:	Lave the Rome Meet	ing as soon as
expected,	The	Agenda for it thus	t be out 20 days
"before the Meeting and the decisions taken on Russia in Paris would oortainly necessitate a good deal of work, so that he doubted whether it would be possible to issue the Agenda till about the 25th. The Meeting would thus take place about the 16th April, Ee intended to consult Signor Ferraris on the matter when in Paris.
In several of these activities it was to some extent made to appear that the League was only acting at the behest of the Supreme Council. This was perhaps a little regretable, but was no solid drawback. When the various questions were brought before the Council we could regard them as being brought up by those Members of the Council who were alsu represented on the Supreme Council,
Oommendatore Anzllotti said that acceptances of the invitation to serve cn the Jurists Committee had been received from the following:- hr. Loder, Laron Descamps, and Lord Phillimore.
M. I.lantoux spoke of the proposed Council document on Russia,
He had prepared it on the lines suggested by the Secretary-General. Eight members should be nominated by the League, the names of 1 c£ whom were to be suggested unofficially beforehand by the principal Allied Powers separately. It was hoped that wo might induce the United States to allow an American to take part. If they would not suggest a name, we should still hope that they would leave the Council free to appoint some individual. The remaining three would bn nationals of the smaller countries, and lb was important if possible to have two neutrals. The Scandinavian countries must of octree
be/
-a-
be represented for they were near Russia and had much knowledge of
it.
Two nominees of the Labour Organisation would also take part in the work of the Commission, at the same time forming a link with the special Labour Commission which it was proposed should consist of six persons, two each for Government employers and workers respectively. This Commission would go simply to enquire into labour conditions and nothing else.
Various authorities had been approached for the purpose of suggesting nameso He had seen Signor Nitti and Viscount Chinda.
M. Monnet and Monsieur de Fleurian were to keep the French Government informed, and the Secretary-General the British. Things must be pushed ahead as much as possible and we ought to hope to get results by the end of July. We must not go back to the old style of letting things drift and hoping they would turn out for the best.
The question v/as raised whether there ought to be a special eoonomio enquiry. The present idea is that each member should have 2 cr 3 experts; in most cases there would be one economic expert amongst them, and these could if necessary be sent off on a special enquiry as a sub-committee which would report under the authority of the main Commission. Mr. Lloyd raised the question whether we should leave this matter to the Commissioners or see to it ourselves. The Supreme Economic Council had got such information as exists about economic and food conditions in Russia and they know the people who ought uo be sent, Should we ask them for names?
If not probably the Saprerne Economic Council would send its own Commission which would surely be undesirable. M. Mantoux pointed out that an economic report would depend much on reports on the political and still more the administrative condition of the country. The Secretary-General said he saw much in the point made by Mr. Lloyd. Ho referred to a communication from General 1,lance who took the view that the most essential subject of enquiry was neither the political nor the economic situation but the transport situation. Vould it not be best to say in the Commission's terms
of reference that each member can take, say, 3 expert advisers and
that /
-4-
that in the Commission's report particular attention would have to be paid to eoonomio, transport and administrative matters; and then leave the Commissioners to draw the obvions conclusions. Ur- Lloyd asked how in this case the actual men would be chosen? He did not wish to leave the matter to the chance of the Commissioners choosing the best men but wished the Supreme Economic Council to suggest names. Mr. Colban pointed out the danger, if such a plan were followed, lest the main Commission should become a purely political one merely accompanied by economic, etc., commissions.
Dr. van Hamel suggested in order to avoid on the one hand gaps and on the other hand overlapping amongst the expert advisers that the Commission should hold a preliminary meeting at which each member should submit the names and qualifications of the advisers he pro-posed to bring, and the Commission itself should then decide whether it would accept or alter the lists. ’The Secretary-General pointed out the practical difficulties in the way of this suggestion. It would he two or three weeks at least before the Commission could hold a prelininary meeting which might even have to take place at Dorpat. If they only at that meeting decided on thâir list of advisers much delay would inevitably be caused.
Dr. van Hamel then proposed that the Secretary-General should ask the Council to give him power to appoint expert staff and Mr. lloyd suggested that a number of experts should be separately appointed and put on the International Secretariat of the Commission. Me might, for instance, ask General îlance for the name of a man to put on that Secretariat. Mr. Co lb an emphasised, the point that the main Commission must remain in effective charge of the whole Enquiry; in particular, when a sub-committee was charged with a special enquiry, one or two members of the main Commission should he at the head of it. The Secretary-General said he had already asked General Mance to come and see him. On the general points raised, he thought they presented much food for thought and that it would be best to adjourn the discussion of them for the present.

of a Meeting held, in the Becretary-General1s room on Wednesday, March 17th, 1920, at 3c30 p.m.
Present:-	The Secretary-General
Sir Herbert Ames Commendatore Anzilotti Hr. Pawley Bate Pr. Van Zleffens Mr r Gilchrist
The SECRETARY-GEHERAL said that the Paris Council Meeting was satisfactory from the standpoint of the action taken, but unsatisfactory as far as the method of procedure was concerned. The plan for the Russian Commission as prepared in advance had been approved with only slight changes. Difficulties concerning the correct method of expressing the relationship between the League and the Labour Office were solved satisfactorily.
The questions regarding typhus in Poland and the approval of Mr. Balfour's letter concerning health conditions in Central Europe were both discussed for the first time at the public meeting. These problems were easy to deal with and required no previous discussion in private.
An unfortunate incident occurred after the first private meeting on Friday morning. Questions relating to the Russian Commission had been discussed at that meeting, and the Council Members left the room inclined to cavil at the somewhat crowded quarters in which they had been gathered. It was decided to meet in secret in the afternoon to discuss names of prospective members of the Commission. This did not create any new precedent as it had been the practice during previous Council sessions.
A bad leakage, however, occurred in the French Press as to what took place at the Committee meeting on Friday morning. The newspaper story was evidently written with the intention of discrediting Monsieur Thomas in the eyes of the Labour people. The
incident
incident upset the Council considerably and they decided to diminish the number of people at all future Committee Meetings and during the present Session to hold the Committee Meetings in secret. At future Committe'e Meetings each Council member will be accompanied by one secretary only, and although such members of the International Secretariat as are really necessary will be admitted, it is probable, that this will mean a considerable reduction in the number of members of the Secretariat who can attend. No member of the Secretariat was responsible for the leakage. It was an act of stupidity, but it would be impossible to say that such an act would nor occur again and the Council decided to adopt a safer course of procedure.
Two telegrams were received from the Supreme Council on Saturday morning. They concerned the problem of minorities in Turkey and the protection of Armenia. These questions were discussed at some length by the Council of the League on Saturday eveniig , and as a result the Secretary-G-eneral was instructed to go to London in order to get further information from the Supreme Council as to their intention about these matters. It was then the plan to hold another meeting in Paris in about 10 days to two weeks.
Upon his return to London, the Secretary-General said he saw Lord Curzon, President of the Conference acting as the Supreme Council, and discussed these two questions with him at some length. Lord Curzon very strongly urged that a meeting of the League Council should be held in London during Easter week. He said it was important to hold the meeting here as complete information about Armenia was available in London, and Lord Curzon himself could be present at the Council meeting to explain the problems fully. The Supreme Council would in all probability still be sitting here at that tine so that there would be a double advantage in meeting in London0 The programme for future meetings as it stands now is about as follows: April 7,	League Council, London. (Turkish questions only.)
April 11,	Health Conference, Londonl
A rail 26,	League Council, Home.
Week begin-' ing May 2,
International financial Conference, Brussels .
Hot as much, pro gross ag had boon expected has been made for the International financial Conference* Sc-ne difficulties have arisen In connection with the issue of invitations and certain negotiations have been necessary with the Reps.rations Commission. Monsieur Monnet is working on this in Paris now..
In all probability it will not be possible to hold 1he Assembly meeting before November, but it certainly should be held then.
0OMMNPAT 0 R5 AMILO T TI said that four Jurists invited to
become members of the Committee to form plans for the International
Court had accepted the invitation:
Mensieur Pe scamps ,T	Icder
Lord	Phillimore
Monsieur Vesnitch.
Two, however, had been unable to accept:
Monsieur Prago and Monsieur Gram.
Commendstore Anzilotti called attention to the fact that as a result of Monsieur Pragors withdrawal, Spanish South America was no longer represented on the Committee, although Portuguese South America still had the Brazilian nominee as a delegate.
MR. CQLBAN pointed out that this situation was not serious as the Spanish Jurist would sufficiently represent the Spanish speaking countries of South America. PR. PAWLEY LATE noted that among the twelve Jurists Originally invited, five were drawn from the Great Powers and seven from other countries. Two had been unable to accept the invitation, so that now there were five representatives of the Great Powers, and an equal number from the small States. He pointed out that the failure of the Conference at the Hague in 1907 to create an International Court had been due in a large part to the lack rtf harmony between the Great Pov/ers and the smaller States. He thought it was fortunate therefore that both these groups were to be more equally represented on the League Committee for the formation of the Court. C0MMENDAT3KB ANZILOTTI also noted the absence of any representative from Scandinavia, but the Secretary-General pointed out that the Scandinavian countries had expressed their views in the draft programme for an International Court recently prepared at the Hague
and that the Dutch Representative who was at that Hague Conference could sufficiently represent the Scandinavian viewpoint. The Secretary-General thought it would be better not to invite any other jurists to take the place of Messrs.. Drago and Gram. If any explanations were called for, a ¿statement could be made, DR. PAY/LEY BATS asked where the Committee of Jurists would meet, and the SECRETARY-GENERAL-- suggested that Commendatore Anzilotti, after he had received replies to all the invitations, would probably consult the members of the Committee, and that the city whj;&h met with the most general approval would be selected. Ho attempt should be made, he thought, by the secretariat to fix a place for this gathering.
THE SECRETAIff-GEHERAl closed the meeting by announcing that, if possible, all documents for the Rome Session of the Council should be sent out by the third or fourth of April, i.e. before the Council Meeting in Rondon. This of course only referred to ■documents for regular items on the Agenda, not for any special papers which it might be necessary to circulate at a later date.

MINUTES
of a Meeting held in the Secretary GeneralTs Room on Wednesday, the 24th March 1920, at 3*30ep,mn
Present:- The Secretary General Gommendatore Anzilotti Dr* Hitobe Sir Herbert Ames Mr, Colban Monsieur Cornert Monsieur Mantoux Mr, Baher Mr, Lloyd Mr, Wan Kieffens Mr, Walters,
The Secretary General said there were two subjects of special interest at present, that of the Turkish Treaty and that of the financial Conference,
As regards the first of these* the Supreme Council after hearing the Note Verb ale which he had presented to them, altered
i
the proposed clauses of the Treaty which dealt with Minorities, taking out all mention of the League of Nations, except as regards an arrangement by which the Council of the League is to nominate the Chairman of certain Committees, This could be accepted because no executive obligation was involved, A clause was added at the end of the Minorities Clauses providing that the method of giving effect to these clauses shall be decided by means of discussion between the Council of the League and the Supreme Council, Under Whis arrangement there would be no need for special haste in discussing details, which need hardly be decided until after the signature of the Treaty,
The .Armenian question is rather different. The Supreme Council cannot frame the Treaty clauses dealing therewith unless it knows what tho decision of the Council is. It was strongly felt in the Secretariat that the League of Nations ought not to undertake the protection of Armenia, unless sufficient resources were placed at its disposal to enable it to carry out such protection efficiently0 He hoped, therefore, that when the
Council replied to the Supreme Council they would insist on proper guarantees being given« On the other hand, it must net he forgotten - as there was a tendency to do in some quarters -that the Armenian question created very great interest indeed in England and America, particularly the latter. Thus, it would he most undesirable that the Council should reply to the effect that it altogether refused to consider the Supreme CouncilTs suggestiono
As tc the time of the Meeting, a letter from the Secretary of the Supromo Council, which had been forwarded to all Members of tho Council, spoke of tho Meeting being about Easter time in London or Paris« London would bo the most convenient meeting-plaoe, because the experts on the subject are there. In reply to Hons 1our Mantcun,ho said that while there did exist a draft of tho Minorities clauses which the Supreme Council had provisionally accepted, no draft of the Armenian clauses had been considered by them, the reason being that they were waiting for the decision of the Council of the League.
Russian Commission: The telegram of yesterday from the Soviet Authorities, though containing nothing of substance, at any rato showed that they did not intend to ignere the Councilrs decision,, Colonel Chardigny was collecting names and otherwise preparing fer the work of the Secretariat of the Commission,
On receipt of the Soviet1s telegram, he had sent off the telegram of invitation to the American Government.
Mr. Elihu Root had accepted the invitation to serve on the International Jurists1 Committee. This soened a good sign, and one that shewed that tho Republican Party did not disinterest itsolf in the League»
Financial Conference: Monsieur Mcnnet was returning from Paris that night, and he hoped that invitations to tho Conforenco, including that to the United States, could gc out soon.
Rome Meeting- of the Council: The Supreme Council was, he understood, going tc meet at San Remo on the 21st April. This seemed a further reason for adhering to the date of the 27th April for the CouncilTs Meeting in Rcmo0
-3-
Finally he referred to the death, after an operation, of Mr0Go 1. Boer, Director of the Mandates Section. While the attitude of
the Senate made it uncertain wheJ
Mr. Boer would eventually have
coen aole to join the Secretariat, there could he no doubt that ho was a man of the greatest intellectual power and knowledge of the subject, and possessed unequalled qualifications for that post.
Sir Herbert Ames:remarked that amongst other points that cams up in calculating the cost of various Conferences was that of the printing of the speeches made and of the eventual Report. We had at present no fixed policy about the production of such Reports. It would be a good thing, from the point of view of Libraries, etch, if the League adopted some standard form, and this would also enable him to fix approximately a standard price. He agreed that not all Conferences stood on the same basis in this respect, o5ga for the Health Conference, which was called mainly in order to prepare a plan for the Council, only a Proces Verbal would be needed and not a Verbatim Report, On the other hand the Financial Conference,seme of whose Meetings would be in public, would involve a Verbatim Report, at any rate of those Meetings. The cost of printing the Report of the International Labour Conference, whioh had been done fu Washington, was 10,000 dollars. The magnitude of this sum suggei jod, the importance of having a standard prioe. On the other hanxti' it ms pointed out that in the case of a large Conference of that kind, the great value of a Verbatim Report was that if produced with sufficient promptitude it enabled all Members to keep au fait with the discussions. At Washington such a Report ox each dayTs Meetings had been circulated at 9 o1clock each evening. This shewed that some printing, at any rate, must be done on the spot. At Sir Heroert AmesTs suggestion, the Secretary General agreed to appoint a small Committee to consider the whole question. Dr .Hi 1-010 said that having just cone back from Switzerland he had one or two points of general interest to bring before the Meeting, The first was the general ignorance in Switzerland about the constitution, etc», of the LoagtC, of which he had met very many examples, even amongst well informed persons.
As regards the Meeting of the League of Red Gross Societies, this ms the first time that the League had sent Delegates to a Meeting of that kind, and the League’s interest in the Meeting had been much appreciated end frequently referred to«
International Bureaux*, He had visited all the public ones in Switzerland and in Paris, and had noted a few general points, the first of which was the great ago of the Directors. Some of them were over 80, and the average age was well over 70„ Secondly, they seemed much afraid of being required to move to the seat of the League. Monsieur Ador had spoken to him about this, and he had replied unofficially that he did not personally think the League would require such removal* Monsieur Ador appeared to be much relieved by this, Many of the Bureaus wero in financial difficulties, and either havo asked or are asking the Governments concerned for from two to five times the previous contributions« finally, he thought that the League of Nations, without definitely inviting the Bureaux to place themselves under its direction, would find that they all would ultimately desire to do so of their own accords Monsieur Oomort said that Dr. ITitobe’s first point shewed the difficulty of our problem. In no country did She Press discuss the League so much as in Switzerland, Many articles appeared about it every day, and yet this state of ignorance continued. Tho only way to fight it is by strengthening the International Associations«
He had been working for this in franco, and Signor Villari was doing the sane in Italy0 Mrc_Baker agreed. He referred to the idea of the League of Nations Union to got a message from the Council saying that such Associations were of value. Es had suggested as an alternative to this that they should get messages from individual Members of the Council in connection with the forth-coining Meeting of tho Voluntary International Associations, which was planned for the 10th June in Rome, The Secretary General said this could come from tho whole Council,
and asked
-5-
Monsleur Oomert to prepare a Resolution for the Council to pass at its Meeting in Rome. In further discussion about Propaganda'^' it was urged that those responsible for it should mate it their	^
chief effort to make the simple facts about the League, e,g. its Membership and Constitution, known.

of a Meeting held, in the Secretary General1 s room on Wednesday, the 31st March, 1920, at 5o30 p.m.
Present:- The Secretary General Monsieur Monnet Commendstore Anzilotti Hr , Nitote Sir Herbert Air.es Mr. Colban Monsieur Comert Tr. van Hamel Mr. Baker Mr. Lloyd Mr. 'Walters.
The Secretary General said it was unfortunately still impossible to fix definitely the date of the Special Meeting of the Council which depended on the date of the Supreme Council Meeting at San Remo,
The Supreme Council, he understood, was to cease its sittings in London to-day or to-morrow, and would not meet again until the San Remo Meeting, the suggested dates for which varied from the 12th April, or even earlier, to the 19th April. It would then oontinue, and perhaps complete, its discussion of the Turkish Treaty, so that the Council of the League ought to reply to the two telegrams hefors then.
As regards the place of the Meeting, if the Turkish experts at the time were in London, it ought to be London, if they were in Paris, it ought to be in Paris.
Besides Armenia and the Turkish Minorities, it would probably be neoessary to put on the Agenda the Tanzig Election scheme, submitted by Sir Reginald Tower. He had publicly announced the date of the Elections as the 16th May. If the Counoil waited to discuss thorn until its Rome Meeting, and then made some modifications in the conditions, it would be extremely inconvenient.
The Romo Meeting:whatever the date of the Special Meeting, we should still try to hold the Rome Meeting on the 26th April, as arranged.
This would/
-2-
This would hold even if the Meeting was held as lata as the 10th April,
The Agenda and necessary documents for Rome ought, if possible, to he circulated not later than next Hednesday, so as to allow an interval of three weeks before the Meeting.
He would like to add that in drafting Council Documents, we ought, generally speaking, to he careful not to give too muob indica- ^ tion that one line of policy commended itself rather than another.	<+
The Council, with some reason, did not like it, and it was apt to have the opposite effeot to that which was desired.
Arrangements for the Council Meetings: Prohahly in future each Member of the Council would take one adviser only to Committee Meetings, For special questions, Members might prohahly ask leave to introduce a second adviser. In the same way, as regards the Secretariat, he hoped to get the leave of the Council to have present what staff was necessary, tut during the discussion of each question^-only those specially concerned with that question would ha able to bs aotually present at the discussion.
Commendatore Anailotbl said that he had just heard unofficially that Professor Fadda was accepting the invitation to serve On the International Jurists Committee, and that the Brazilian and Japanese Jurists were the only ones that had not replied.
Sir Herbert Ames: raised the question of the Publio Meetings at Rome, Would there he only one or two public Meetings at the end of say a week of Committee Meetings, or would they ho sandwiohed?
From the newspaper point of view, the latter was much preferable,
Monsieur Comert agreed. In partioular the fact that the Permanent Armaments Commission was being dealt with ought to be made the most of in the Press, hut if that and the Siberian Prisoners were the only matters of general interest for discussion one Publio Meeting would prohahly be enough, Sir Herbert Ames thought that in view of the statement which had appeared in the Press that the Soviet Government was waiting for the Meeting in April of its Executive Committee before returning an answer to the Secretary General's telegran, it might he expected that the Russian question would also
come up/
-3-
come up for discussion.
Mr. Baker askei whether it was impossible to put the question of the Siberian Prisoners on the Agenda for the Special Meeting.
Time was of great importanoe and if the Commissioner were not appointed till the beginning of May, and then had to begin his work by ascertaining the real facts of the situation he would be able to do little before winter set in, which it must be remembered was early in those parts. It would be proposed that the Commissioner should have power to negotiate with all the Governments concerned in the name of the League, as well as to oo-erdinate the voluntary efforts being made by various Societies, tut as regards Finance, should only have power to make suggestions to the Council.
Monsieur Monnet expressed the opinion that the Financial part of the question was the essential one, and the one that presented greatest difficulty. He concluded from the papers on the subject that the expense would be not less than £8,000,000, apart from the cost of feeding the Prisoners on the journey. This was a very large sum and wo must not under-estimate the great difficulty of raising it. While agreeing entirely with the object of the proposal and agreeing also that it was properly a matter for the League, and that the co-ordination of the efforts of the Swedish Red Cross and other voluntary workers was of great importance, nevertheless he was doubtful as to the means suggested for carrying it out. The league would be put in a bad position if, by appointing a Commissioner, it aooepted the charge of resouing these Prisoners, and then through fail^re raise the funds, had to admit that it could do little.
He questioned whether we ought not first to make sure of the financial side and then appoint out Commissioner. Mr. Baker thought we stood a better ohanoe of raising the money if we appointed a man to make
a full investigation into the faces, draw up a comprehensive plan, and base on thaiti an authoritative estimate, so that we could say to the Governments, ”the whole work is ready to be begun and gone straight ahead with as soon as you can provide so much credit”. The Secretary
General/
General thought that the differences between the two points of view an
was not/essential one.
The title ,,CommissionGli,,cr "High-Oommissioner" was misleading,
and should be avoided. V/hat the Council could safely do in his
opinion was (1) to appoint a man to ascertain the true facts as far
«
as possible, (£) to Instruct whoever was appointed,to investigate th© question of the necessary credits and to report to the Council.
(3)	to explain to him that there was already much private and certain governmental effort being made to deal with the question and to ask him to endeavour to oc-ordinatc- this activity with a view to avoiding overlapping.

The secretary General said that most of those present at the Meeting had attended the Council session in Paris, and that it ifrcs unnecessary to
Vvt	-. Uc	. ^
discuss the decisions! made there. The Meeting went off very smoothly, and A	V
the council of its own accord was ready to adopt the line of action
Av	A--., 1. -
J proposed—by the secretariat, although it wee- impossible to indicate this
line of action in advance, sir Herbert Ames mentioned the lack of Press
notice which the Meeting had received in the London paperssecretary

General said that he was lanning to lock thnto this question.
%
After briefly reviewing the decisions of the Council regarding Armenia and the question of the Protection of Minorities in Turkey, the secretary General alluded to the nomination of Hansen to take charge of the investigation in connection with Prisoners of War in Russia, ne said that the- telegram was despatched to Hansen last Saturday, but no reply had yet been received. The 4th question discussed in Paris was that of the Elections in Danzig. Mr. Golban’s proposals were accepted unanimously without discussion.
The Italian Ambassador had suggested the postponement of the Rome Meeting to the bth May, and the Council had decided that the 7th May would be a
4~i
suitable date for the opening session, v/hich would probably continue for
A
about ten days. The Italian Government had been asked if that date would be convenient. The Agenda for the Rome Meeting was discussed by the Council jCr and approved. This finished the proceedings iruParis.
It was the opinion of the Membe s of the Council that the Meeting of the Assembly should be called as soon as possible. It wo,Id be three or
four
- 2 -
four months after the date for the Meeting has been decided upon before it c uld actually take place, as it would be necessary to send out the Agenda, and to allow each country time to choose and send Delegates. These Delegates would have to study the Agenda, consult with their Governments about the various questions, and have sufficients time for travelling. All this would take from three to for months, so
A i*. ^ t*- h*1
that the Assembly could ruaL_po-&6i-bly be held before October.	_
xhe secretary General also remarked upon the interest of various council Members in the financial problems of the League, particularly on the question of the Monetary Unit, and the date for the ending of the fiscal near. It was Dr. van Heme 1' s impression that most of them favoured the '¿1st December, The peel's tary General also said that he thought it would be wise to explain to the Members of the League about the size of initial payments requested of them. It should be clearly shewn that first payments covered expenditures not only during the three months ending the 31st March, 192U, but also all the initial expenses dating from the appointment of the secretary Goreral in May, 1919. com enaatore Anzilot i announced that the Meeting of Jurists to form plans for the International court could not be held before June, and he thought that it would last about a month.
There might be some overlapping with the Financial Conference, but it was noi^ thought that this would be serious, although arrangements for Interpreters would have to be assured.
At the request of the Secretary General. Mr. Layton reviewer the situation with regard to the Financial Conference. Invitations v. uld be sent out that night or the following night. A copy of the regular invitation, with a special memorandum from the Secretary General, would be sent to the United States, in all probability the United states Chamber of Com .e ce, would be willing to send Representatives.
This was particularly likely as the United States had alreadyuecided to take part in another Financial Conference which was to consider the disposal of Relief credits, and which would bring together Great Britain, Sweden, Holland and perhaps other countries.
Considerable discussion ensue-a as to the wisest course to pursue in connection with the American invitation. The secretary General thought that if Representatives of the Government could be expected no other possible course should be suggested, and it was concluded that no direct reference to the possibility of unofficial representation by the appointment of Delegates from the Chamber of Commerce should be made. This might, however, be talked over informally with the American Ambassador.
- ô -
jar« Layton continued by saying that the Conference would be held on the üoth May, and that the secretary General haa already written to Lord drey about accepting the chairmanship of this gathering. A provisional agenda had been prepared to be sent outt. -s**Although it was primarily a conference of Members of the League, all the Members 'the Loogae-had not been invited» invitations had been sent to about zo, but only to three states in south America,' chile, * argentine, and hrazil. The United States and Roumania were also to be invited, and négociations concerning Delegates from rdc-nnemy Powers had been started. sir Herbert ames raised the question as to who were Members of the League, and
as to what otates were to be admitted to the Assembly. The secretary general thought that such states as naiti, Honduras, .Nicaragua, which had. not acted

satisfactorily closed if Prance should report now to the League on the/question.
Mr. Colban agreed, provided that such action would not be taken as establishing a precedent in favour of pacific Military action by an individual Power in case of similar situations in the future. Mr. Baker thought that the German
contention with regard to the part which the League should have played was -~tl
stronger frferh Dr. van Hamel intimated. There had been two acts of war, and
A
this might always lead to trouble. Mr. Colban suggested that as the German documents had already been submitted to the League, France might also submit
hers. This would show that Prance recognised the interest of the League in the
wrv'
matter. The Secretary General said that if the -question were brought up, either
A -LJ
(1) Prance would say that the problem was one for the League, but that there was-—
no time to bring it before the Council, or (2) it would be taken up under
Article 11, and come immediately before the Council. He thought that the.whole

In concluding this discussion the ¡Secretary G neral thought that to counteract as—aaeSiiy-propaganda, it might be suggested that Germany’s case was so vseak that she could not get any Member of ihe League to take it up, and that, therefore, it did not come before the Council.
Mr. baker asked about publicity arrangements for the Health conference, as he noticed that nothing had appeared in the Press so far. The secretar? General thought that something should be done about this, and suggested that Mr. baker should see Mr. Mair upon his return from Paris.

The 3eoretary-General mentioned the fact that Signor Nitti had telegraphed to M. Bourgeois saying that the 7th May would not "be a possible date for the Rome Meeting and asking that it might he postponed either till the 14th or for an indefinite time.
M. Bourgeois was ready to agree to the 14th and had asked what Mr. Balfour1a view would he. Mr. Balfour was away and there was reason to think that he oould not go to Home at that time. Nevertheless, for various reasons, it seemed hatter to agree to hold the Council in Rome on the 14th. Other Members of the Council oonsulted by M. Bourgeois had agreed. Further, it now appeared not Impossible that Mr; Balfour might attend. We could take it that barring unforeseen obstaoles the 14th would stand.
He assumed as a consequence that the date of tho Financial Conference would bo May 23th. If put forward to the gist it would cut across the Whitsuntide holiday - Mr. Layton agreed that it was worth losing a week in order to get the date fixed;»if therefore the Belgian Government agreed we can definitely fix and announce the 28th without further consultation with the Council, gotting the assent of M. Bourgeois through M. Monnet» It was hoped that the Rome Meeting would begin on Friday, the 14th, meeting on Friday and Saturday and all through the following week and concluding Its
business/
-2-
businoss tv Saturday, the 2End, This would give five days for transference of the necessary staff to Brussels,
Those present would have seen the unfortunate announcerenf in the London press with reference to the Armenian Mandate» he „'as now trying to got the agreement of the Supreme Council to the publication of the CouncilTs Memorandum in order to correct the misapprehension. He thought they would agree to this, more especially as ho had heard privately that Lord Curzon saw no objection to it.
The review of the Press produced by the Information Section at present occupied the time of a considerable staff and, if continued in its present form, would necessitate a certain addition to that staff. The review is only for internal use in the Secretariat and he is doubtful as to the desirability of continuing it«, He asked Directors to consider whether they thought that it justified further expenditure on personnel or whether their purpose would be served by the circulation of an index giving a list of articles of possible interest from which they could select and ask for those they wished to see. This would allow the Information Section to carry on with its present staff. He did not wish to have to present to the Council a noticeably long list of personnel for the Information Section, since this might lead them to think that we were using for propaganda purposes a part of the money paid by the Governments for the expenses of the League,
M. Oomert said that if the second alternative were adopted his Section would still issue the review of the British Press and also o review made from tho point of view of the League,

Sir Herbert Anos suggested that a system of dossiers might he introduced, cuttings on special subjects being collected and circulated at intervals to the Sections concerned, inis plan would have the advantage of ensuring the ultimate return of the cuttings to the Information Section-.
IvL Homert thought that this system would have disadvantages as the dossiers would be always unfinished and could only he in the hands of one Section at a time, whereas they would have to deal with subjects of interest to more than one Section, He thought that the infernation of the kind referred to by Mr, Layton would be sufficiently assured by the review which the Information Section would still circulate, together with the "Review of the foreign Press” published in London, a similar publication prepared in jfrance and a third which lie had discovered viao produced by the Germans and seemed to bo very good on economic subjects0

j,vr Layton said that since the last mooting Lord refused the Chairmanship of the Financial Conference on account of his defective sight. !T. Bourgeois was thinking about other possible names.

■The Secrotary-Conopal said that having been asked by different people what the British Government meant to do, ho had replied that they were going to appoint one Government, ono banking and one trade representative* He thought that Sweden, at any rate, meant to do the same«
Hr♦ Layton, said that- Lame Rachel Crowdy, Sir Herbert nines and himself had seen Sr, Buchanan with reference to the financing of the typhus campaign. They had made suggestions to him in the direction of strengthening the case put forward in the Eealth Conference Resolution, e.g, it should state whether the estimate provided for a chain across Europe and not only for Poland; it should state too what the polish Government is doing. The amount involved, it now seemed possible, might not exceed £1,000,000 before next Winter, of which £400,000 would be for food. This latter sum might possibly come out of the special food fund which was being provided for Central Europe, so the Total was reduced to manageable proportions. Dr, Buchanan did not feel competent to mate recommendations as to the financial arbitrations to be asked for from the different Govern.rents, but he strongly urged that the question should be regarded as of equal interest to all parts of the world since another timo the League might have to deal with epidemics in Asia or elsewhere.
Sir Herbert Ames said he had explained to Dr, Buchanan that we could not without special authorisation collect money, save under the terms of Article 5, also that we must have a really
careful/

oarefül estimate which oan he fully explained.
The Seeretary-Cenoral said he could understand the reluctance of the medical experts, hut thought they should not he afraid to make propositions.
Sir Herbert Ames said he had also told Dr. Buchanan that if a special High Commissioner was appointed his expenses and those of his staff could come out of our general funds. The money for the campaign., however, would have to he specially collected.
He thought the situation emphasized the necessity for an early meeting of the Assembly as till that event there was no machinery for financing big affairs,

The Secretary-General said that there was little to report. The 14th May still held good as the probable date of the Home Meeting.
Mr. Balfour would be the British Bepresentative. The Special train for Rome would leave Paris on the 11th May.
He referred to the Meeting which had been arranged between the representatives of the Allies and delegates of the German Government at Spa on the 25th May. He hoped that the date had been chosen in
order to make it possible, if desired, for a statement to be made at
1 ♦
the Conference on the subject of reparations.
As regards the indiscretion committed by the "Times" in publishing the Armenian Memorandum that morning, he outlined the facts of the case, viz. that on the 23rd April he had telegraphed to Sir Maurice Hankey at San Reno, saying that in view of the misrepresentations which had appeared, it appeared desirable to publish the memorandum, and this would bo done on the Tuesday, unless a request came from ban Remo to the contrary. Ho reply having been received up to midday on Monday the memorandum was at 3 p.m. given out to the Press. At about 6.45 on Monday night, a message was received asking that publication should be postponed. Every effort was made to see that this was done, and in fact no publication took place on Tuesday.This being so, wc could not accept any responsibility for the action of the "Times". He did not know whether, from our point of view a great deal of harm had been done.	Mons 1eur Comert said that after
seeing the comment in the Westminster Gazette he thought there was
no/
-g-
no great harm done. He understood a question would he asked in the House of Commons to-morrow on the subject. The Seeretary-General mentioned that in view ox that possibility, he had already sent an aocount of the incident to the Foreign Office, and to the Prime Minister1s Secretary.
Commendatore Anztlotti said that Monsieur Adachi had accepted the invitation to serve on the Jurists Commission. Monsieur Wini&rski, who had been invited to serve on the Expert Secretariat of the Committee, had sent no reply.
Sir Herbert Ames said that the proposed statement about the provision of funds for the anti-typhus campaign could not be drawn up until Mr. Layton’s return, i,e. at the end of the present week.
Some discussion took place regarding the Swiss Plebiscite. Monsieur Mantuux understood that the Swiss authorities felt confident as to the results of the voting per capita, but not about the necessary majority of Cantons. The question was raised whether the Swiss Constitution excluded the possibility of a second Referendum being held shortly afterwards, supposing the result of the first were unsatisfactory, i.e. supposing the League secured a substantial majority of individual votes, but not of Cantonal votes. Dr.van HameH said that in his opinion if this course were taken Switzerland could not become an original member. Her whole action in respect of joining the League would have to ho begun de novo.
The Secretary-General said that no reply had ¿et been received from the Soviet Authorities. It was a question whether the Council at its Home Meeting ought not to inform'the Supreme Council of the position. A report might he made to the Supreme Council when it met on the 25th May. Ho attached little importance to the Socialist Mission which had set out that morning. It was natural that the Soviet Government should not oppose Its coming to Russia, seeing that it was extremely small, and included few, if any, persons who understood Russian.
Dr.- Hltobe referred to the general lack of information about.
the actual work which was being done by the League.
Oiecig u«. The Secreta-c y-
Genoral thought, as regards this country we could give information
to the/
~7>-
to the League of nations Union, so that they oould publish it. It was suggested that a weekly bulletin of information might be issued to them, ivlonsieur Gonert thought that this could not be done at present. We, however, gave to the League of Hattons Union all matter that could be given to the Press.

of a Directors’ Meeting held in the Secretary-General’s room at 3.Z0 p.m. on Wednesday, the 5th May, 1920.
Present:- The Secretary-General Dr. Iii t oh e Sir Herbert Ames Mr. Co lb an M. Comert Dr. Van Hamel Mr. Layton M. Mantoux
Mr. Walters (Secretary)'
The Secretary General said as regards the agenda for Rome nothing^ a© far as he knew, had "been added to the list circulated on the 1st May Since the last regular meeting two new points had arisen. First, the question whether the Financial Conference would have to he postponed.
He had not yet heard finally as to who was to he suggested to the Council as Chairman, hut expected that this would have been decided in principle before the Rome meeting, and weuld he formally confirmed
r \
there. Secondly, place and time of the meeting of the International Jurists Committee. Mr. Hammerskjoeld had, at his request, gene to see M. Hymans, and had suggested to him that in view of the Dutch invitation to hold this at -The Hague , and of the fact that the Financial Conference was to he held at Brussels, he should withdraw the invitation made by Baron Descamps cn behalf of the Belgian Government. He hoped the Committee would meet fairly early in June, and if the weather were hot he thought The Hague would offer some advantages as compared with an inland city.
de might perhaps expest to finish up at Rome on the 22nd May; what then would be the best date for the next Council meeting? This must depend to some extent on the date cf the Assembly, and that date would not be definitely fixed by the Council, which would he hoped decide however that the Assembly should meet in October. The necessary documents ought to be despatched to the Governments concerned three months before.the date of the Meeting. The Japanese
Ambassador/
Ambassador had made a special point of this as far as his Government
was concerned. Therefore the Council should have passed if possible
all the important documents by the end of July. He hoped, perhaps,
that the next Council Meeting, therefore, might take place on about
the 20th July. If so, it could take the Report of the International
Jurists Committee, also that of the Health Conference on the Permanent
Health Body. There was just this difficulty, that the Constitution
of Danzig would have been drawn up by about the middle of June, and
Sir Reginald Tower was most anxious that it should be formally
promulgated at the same time as the Danz ig-Poland Treaty which was
to be on the 15th July. This being so, it would probably be necessary
to have a special interim meeting towards the end of June for this
the
and one or two small subjects. He hoped, then, that after/july
meeting we could live in peace till just before the Assembly meeting
so far as the preparatory work for the Assembly meeting was concerned-,
Mr. Celban pointed out that the Council might have to deal with the
Turkish Minorities question before the Assembly met. Sir Herbert Ames
asked whether it would be necessary for the schemes for different
permanent bodies to be submitted in detail to the Assembly Members
three months ahead. The Secretary General said he thought yes as
regards the Health Body and the Court, no as regards the Armaments
Commission. He did not expect that on this it would be possible
the
to report in time for the first meeting of/Assembly.
Sir Herbert Ames pointed out that if we received auenority at Rome to send out the questiormairo on which the new proposals for the unit rating of the Members are to be based, we could not e: pect to receive replies till September 1st at earliest. The Secretary General agroc-d, and said that we must be content to warn the Members that the question would como up, adding that we would circulate full information as soon as we could. Though not a question of first class importance, it was, he thought, one that would arouse a good deal of discussion. In any case, it must come up at the first Assembly.
Dr . van Hame 1 /
3-
Dr. van Hamel asked whether it waa intended to suggest to Assembly Members that they could bring up questions which they desire to have placed on the Agenda. The Secretary General said that he thought that his letter informing them of the Rome decision as to date should contain a request that the Secretariat might be informed as quickly as possible of any such d6Sire. It would be useful for the Council to be informed of any response to this request, though it did not rest with the Council to decide whether qeastion should or should not be on the Agenda for the Assembly.
Mr. hayton said that he hoped that it would be possible to get the Chairman of the Pinanc ial Conference actually appointed before Rome, though the appointment would, of course, havo to be confirmed there. There was a lot/hat he ought to do, and as soon as it was settled who he should be, he would propose to go and see him.
He added that the results of the financial Conference would not be able to be prepared for circulation three months before the Assembly Meeting.
Sir Herbert Ames Baid the only thing he desired to say was
a pleasant one, viz. that the League's bank balance was unusually large.
Mr. Co lb an said that had it not been for Mr. Bonar Law's declaration in Parliament yesterday, to the effect that the British Government was not prepared to propose that the Polish advance should be brought before the Council of the League under Article 11, he had intended to suggest that something of the kind ought to be done. Although the war was not begun subsequently to the coming into force of the Covenant, it was bad from a propaganda point of view that the League took no notice of it. What he had intended to suggest was that the Council should draw the attention of the
Polish Government/
polish Government to the fact that their action was of interest to the other Members and. that those Members ought to be kept informed of the situation. This would not, he thought, expose the League to a snub, while it would remind Poland of her duties as a Member, and would make a very good impression on the United States and on the States formerly neutral. The Secretary General said he was doubtful on what grounds the League could interfere. The Soviet Government had never been recognised, so it could not call on both parties to submit the dispute to the League, not could it exoroiso any control of any kind over the Soviet Government. Monsieur Mantoux said that possibly the Poles might might come to desire a settlement, and therefore ask for the League to intervene. This would be a very different thing from the League interfering out of the blue, so to speak. On a oonstitutional point, he thought the matter could only be brought up by a Member of the League. Air. Layton said that the situation was closely bound up with the question of the movement of arms and military stores from Western to Eastern Europe. Gould not those Members of the League who had signed the Arms Traffic Convention bo asked by the Council to agree to stop the export of arms pending the formulation of the League’s proposals for the reduction of armaments. Dr. van Hamel said that the States signatory to that Convention were nominally bound by one of its clauses to act from the moment of signature as though it had been finally ratified. This meant that they could not export arms to civilised countries except under licence and had to render returns shewing what licences had been given. Mr. Layton said in that case we ought to ask for such returns to be made at once, and in future at short intervals, otherwise there was no control. Ho thought it important that the Council should consider this point at Rome.
The Secretary General said that on both points some Member of the League must bring the question before the Council, but though we frequently heard complaints that the League of nations did not act, no Member seemed ready to set its machinery in notion.
Mr»Colban /
gr, Colban said this was because the Governments, and especially the Foreign Ministers, did not recognise the League as a living thing, hr. van Hamel said the case seemed to him to be one fox informal talk in the Council, taking advantage of the fact that a Polish representa tive would be there in connexion with the typhus. M. Comert thought Poland could be induced to bring it up as they were very anxious about the impression made by their advance. Mr. Colhan thought the same, and thought that the Polish statement should be given full publicity, and that it should then be left to public opinion, if it felt strongly about it, to force some Government to bring the whole case before the League.
Dr. van Hamel asked whether the Allied Note to Germany could net be treated in the same way. If the French Government replied to the German Note, and communicated their reply to the League the two would of course be circulated together; but this did net cover the case of the Allied Note from San Remo to Germany. He urged that the Council should make a statement as to the position of the League vis & vis the situation created by the Note, not necessarily for publication, but for circulation to all the Governments. A summary, too, could be published, which would remind the world that the League existed. The statement need not be addressed to the Supreme Council, but it should remind all concerned that Such action as was conditionally contemplated by the Note was of general interest to the Members of the League, an caught not to be taken withGut at least information being given to the Council. The Secretary General thought that it would be most unwise to touch the question now. In a few months the difficulty would disappear if Germany became a Member cf the League. The opinion would undoubtedly be formed that the Council assented to the theory that military occupation of territory was under certain circumstances allowed by the Covenant. Finally, he did not think any Member of the Council
would make/
11
— 6-
would make the proposal. Monsieur Co mart thought that when in Paris we could feel the ground, and that we should be sure of the result before we made a move.

MI1IUTES OP A DIRECTORS MEETING- held in the Secretary General's Room, at 3,20 p.m. on Wednesday, the 26th May, 1920.
Present:	The Secretary General
Dr. Hitote Sir Herbert Ames Mr. CoIban Mrc Layton Mr. Mair
Mr. Walters (Secretary)
The Secretary General said that at the Council Meeting at San
j
Sebastian on the 27th July, any Agenda for the Assembly which had not previously been considered must be discussed and decided upon.
He proposed to send to all the Members of the League a letter informing them of the telegram despe tened to President Wilson, and saying that it was hoped that the Meeting would take place in the first fortnight of November, and to send at the same time a provisional Agenda list, requesting that if any Member wanted any additional question put on this list they should communicate with him not later than the 15th July.
There would no doubt be a Council Meeting between San Sebastian and the Assembly, but it might take place only a short time before the Assembly met.
Referring to the Persian question, he said that he had telegraphed to Signor Tittoni asking if he would agree to the calling of a Meeting in London ten days after the receipt of his reply. He trusted that Signor Tittoni would answer in the affirmative. •
Mr. Colban asked whether the report from the Secretary General on the work done by the League, which would no douht have to bo laid before the Assembly, must be ready by the 27th July? The Secretary General said that he thought that, being entirely a question of facts, this ieport need not be submitted to the Council at all „
As regards the work arising out of the Rome Meeting, he had sent round a rough schedule of this. He feared it was rather heavy, more especially that falling to the share of Sir Herbert Ames.
Mr. Layton said that he wished now to get the date of the
Brussels/
russels Conference definitely announced. The Spa négociations ight last as long as the Peace Cûnference itself, and he thought that the right line was to say that such and such a date - perhaps he 16th July - was fixed for the Meeting, adding that an àjournment of the Conference might "be necessary in respect of the questions of Reparations and an International loan. He intended to go to Paris on the same day as Monsieur Ador and take the opportunity of talking with him on the train. The moment the date had been fixed, he proposed to start giving information to the Press, e.g. the first list of Delegates' names, and so on. He thought that we ought to issue to the Press all Documents given to the Delegates.
They were not confidental, and were purely educative. There was not like ly to he any objection by any Government since the facts they contained would all have been separately published already. The present view of the Advisory Conmittee was that all Sessions of the onference should be open to the Public, though the Sub-Commissions ould sit privately. This would be a good precedent for the Assembly.
Sir Herbert Ames referred to the desire expressed by the ouncil that a small body of the experts assembled in Brussels should draw up a statement of the principles on which they considered that a new allocation of League expenses should be based.
Mr. Layton said there was plenty of time to add this to the Agenda, which had not yet been drawn up in detail. Some of Çhe Sub-ommissions of the Conference might have to go on sitting after he Conference as a whole had adjourned. Indeed, he thought it ery probable that the Conference itself would wish to have a further eeting before the end of the year, and he presumed it would have power to settle this for itself.
Referring to the final Report submitted to the Council dealing with contributions to the expense of fighting Typhus, he said that the principle of allowing for unfavourable exchange in determining contributions was an unsound one, as the facts showed that the rise
fn the cost of commodities and in proportional receipts from axation kept pace with the movements of the exchange. This, therefore, could not figure in the solution of the problem which
the Assembly would have to deal with. Sir Herbert Ames
suggested that it might for particular reasons be necessary to take it into account temporarily. If, however, there was unanimous expert opinion against it, the Assembly could hardly differ therefrom.
Mr. Golban said that he proposed shortly to visit Ilorway, and very likely to pay brief visits to Copenhagen and Stockholm. He proposed to take the opportunity to spread a little information about the Secretariat and the work of the league.
Sir Herbert Ames said he too would shortly be going home, and would probably be called upon to defend the appropriation for the League Budget in the Canadian Parliament. Many other Members of the Secretariat would probably be paying short visits to their own countires during ’this summer, end he suggested that if the Secretary General wished to recommend caution in speaking of any particular matter, this would be a good time for doing so. It was agreed that no special instructions need be given on the subject. The Secretary General thought that it would be particularly useful if the brief statement drawn up by Major Buxton on the work already accomplished by the Council could be brought up to date, and given publicity both by personal action and through the Press. Mr. Mair undertook to see that this was done. He considered that the Press had on the whole given a fairly good publicity to the League of late. The Home results had been translated into many European languages and given to correspondents in London. He referred to the forthcoming Imperial Press Conference, at which he thought it most important that the league should be represented.

The Seeretary-General said that since last Wednesday he had still been trying to get action on the Persian appeal,
Minister Firouz had now made a definite request under the first paragraph of Article 11. The Secretary- General felt that he had to summon a meeting of the Council and he was now merely trying to chose a suitable date. He belie veil it should be as soon as possible, and that if it were not held by Thursday of next week the position would be very awkward. Mr. Walters had gone to Paris the night before to get in touch with Monsieur Mon net and Monsieur Bourgeois. He hoped that the question of a date would be arranged tonight and he believed it would be necessary to plan for a session lasting two days with a public meeting on Friday afternoon.
The Secretary-General understood that an appeal had been
made by Monsieur Benes regarding a settlement of the Teschen dispute
by the League. It appeared as if diplomatic relations had been
broken off between Poland and Czecho-Slovakia, Mo n s ie ur Man 10 ux said
that the Polish Parliament had voted to break off relations, but
that so iTar cts h.e ixu.e\^ no eeo Li l r e o*o1110 m. tjo 1 s d 1 r eo11 on tia d een
taken.	The Secretary-General was of opinion that this
question was outside of the sphere of the Treat;/ and beyond the real
Jurisdiction of the Supreme Council. It was a condition nearly
approaching War. He believed that the League would have to act -
carefully of course - despite the presence of an Interallied
Commission in the Teschen district. The Interallied Commission was
in a /
-2-
jn a difficult position, because if it pronounced any opinion on tpe present question, under dispute	such action would be
oriticised as an attempt to influence the plebiscite. He could not Bee any great danger in sending a League Commission of enquiry to look into this situation. Monsieur Mantoux thought that such a commission ahould be composed entirely of neutrals. Dr Van Hamel thought that this might indicate too much distinction between former Allies and forcer Neutrals, Mr. Colban expressed the view that such a Commission should be sent strictly in conformity with Article 5 of the Covenant„ so that there would be no misunaer"handing as to its status.
The Secretary-General expressed the wish that everyone would prepare material for the July meeting of the Council as soon as possible. He had prepared a list of items for the Agenda and would circulate that for the information of and for suggestions from the various sections,

letter/

the Council at a later date0 The Secretary-general agreed that the first meeting of the Committee of Jurists should be fixed for June 16 at the Hague. .
Monsieur Comert said that as a result of his week:s work in Paris, the Voluntary Association for the League of nations in Prance had really been sot on its feet. Ho said that tho Central Secretariat for the International Association of those Voluntary League Organisations, had not been at all active® It had been set up in Brussels but probably little would be done about tho matter until the meeting of all these various voluntary organisations in Rome next October»
Dr, Nitobe stated that he had just received word that the three propaganda societies for the League in Japan had been amalgamated into one? three months ago. Eg also understood that an official bureau for handling League of Rations affairs had been established in the Foreign Office at Tokio. He outlined a conversation which he had just had with Mr. Hugh Richardson who had attended the session of the International Peace Society in Bale last week* Ton countries had been represented there0 Mr. Richardson said that the gathering had expressed a genoral desire for a League of Rations* but that they had not approved this League be causes (i) it was not
•	•	* - T r J
democratic enough, ice03 the Members of the Assembly were not elected
by the people or approved by tho Rational Parliament; and i'Z) the
League had not taxon the Central Powers into membership early enough$
*
The__Secretary--Goner el explained that the first question had already
been raised in England* The Government had been requested to allow Parliament tc approve or disapprove its representatives on the League Councilo The Government replied that it was necessary for it to have a man who could speak entirely for the Administration, but that the Parliament of course had the authority to turn the Government out of office if it wished to disapprove the representative named0
Monsieur Mautoux also noted that if the League Council or
Assembly/

Assembly consisted only of parliamentary représentât ires, it would beeemo cither (l) a debating- society like the Inter«parliamentary Union or (2) the Parliament of a Superstate « 51?« Yan Hamel said that of oourBe any Government could allow Parliament to choose its own delegates9 Individuals shonld therefore complain to their own Governments about this matter not to the league it3elf0
The Secretary'General mentioned to It« hit 0be that Mr 0 Dosirdo wanted to place tho question of Longue patronage for the
new International University at Brussels on the Agenda of the July Council mooting. This had been done and the F,scretary~General said that ho hoped that Ur. Kitobe would go to Brussels and rnako an investigation of the status of this UniTorsity0 Tho institution wanted patronageu not moneyn	If it would probably prove a successc the league should
fioubtless give it support; otherwise it would be better to leave It aXono 0
Mr» Go lb an said that he had ashed MXc Spicer, in lciiie5 for a copy of tho Ur-aft Turkish treaty0 Two days ago he had had a reply
¡from Ur» Spicer to the effect that the Foreign Office could not furnish him with this document as similar requests from other sources had been refuse do Mr. Colbnn wondered if the fu.pr-ome Council should
not hoop the Secretariat frilly informed about such
uni- 0
ter as this
especially as it had ashed tho collaboration of the Council of tho league with regard to certain parts of the Treaty, Moreover, tho
British representative on tho league Council had requested the Secretariat to study certain minorities questions arising under it and it was very difficult not to have all the data at hand to work one £0or0tary- 0pnnra.i said that we had no claim on the entire ¡Treaty, bet that wo certainly had a right to such sections as concerned the leaguey. Kr. Oolban pointed out that it was very difficult to toll wlai sections did and what sections did not concern tho League0 It would be no os usury for any ■liO 12.0 authorities in Turkey or in forme:?' Turkish territories tc collaborate with such other International
t
Gcianiasions or bodies as might be £a legated to act there0 Ho also said.
that the legal Section needed ube 3!ra?t Treaty for their work „ She
fuprGme Council had, of course, promised to notify the league of
cfcsfiigea made with regard to the Minorities Clauses, but for the general
work/
-5~
Lorfe of the Secretariat, it would certainly ho moat valuable to have the entire text at least six weeks before the Treaty was signed*
The Secretary-General then requested Mr« Colban, Monsieur Mantoux and 2>r. Van Hamel to prepare a letter to Mr. Lloyd George or Sir Maurice Hankey formally requesting the document, There was some discussion &3 to who was President of the Supreme Council and as to whom this letter should he sent«, It was finally decided to advise with Sir Maurice Hankey on the matter*
Mrc Colban expressed the belief that when the Council meeting on the Persian question was convened, an explanation ox the delay which had occurred should bo irs.de for the benefit of the Pres3 and especially fox- the sake of the small countries who might bo extremely worried if they thought it would take fourteen days to summon a meeting of the Council in a real emergency. The Secretary-General observed that it would be useless to have a Council Meeting unless the delegates should come with instructions from their Governments Mr, Baker said that he had received interesting letters from Berlin regarding the good impression which. Dr, Hanson was making there. The political effect so far as the status of the Leaguo was concerned had been oxceilentc He hoped that it might be possible to put into the Press a large amount of information about the work against Typhus 82 well as the work for the Prisoners of War0 He believed it was quite desirable to create a proper atmosphere to precede the appeal

The Secretary General, after some discussion of the situation between Persia and the Soviet Government, went on to the question of the Teschen dispute* Monsieur Benes in his letter confined himself to ashing the League to say which of the two parties were to blame for the dispute which had taken place; he did not specifically ask the Council to decide the future fate of the Province. He questioned whether this were a subject which the Council oould properly take up. He was informed that the Conference of Ambassa-iors had suggested to both parties that they should accept the mediation of King Albert. If they did so, it seemed to him useless for the League oo concern itself with finding out who was to blame for troubles of which a settlement had been found. Monsieur Mantoux said that he thought some correspondence between the Secretariat and Monsieur Benes should take place on the matter. If desired, he would write privately. The Secretary General thought that it would be better to wait a little, as we did n^o know what the result of the offer would be, and even the fact that it had been made was not yet public property. Dr. van Hamel said that he thought that Monsieur BeneS’s letter really raised the whole question of the disposal of Teschen. Monsieur Mantoux thought, on the other hand, that the letter took for granted that the arrangements made in
Paris, viz. that there should be a Plebiscite, held good, and
merely /
S'
merely asked the Council to consider tho question of the temporary and local had feeling between the Poles and Gaocho*-
Slovaksu
Aaland Islands: This question looked very black, though the league had not been officially informed of the existence of the dispute:	The boundaries of Finland had never been confirmed*
Commendatore Anrllotti, with reference to the Meeting at The Hague, asked whether it was necessary to refer to the Council the changes made as regards certain Members of the Committee, viz „ the substitution of Messrs, Weiss and liioci-Bnsatti for Messrs» Eromageot and Fad&ao The Secretary -C enernl thought that with the authority of Monsieur Bourgeois and Signor Tittoni he could go ahead in the matter, subject to ultimate confirmation
by the Councilc
Dr,Van Hamel remarked that Monsieur Weiss would be working in close collaboration with Monsieur Bourgeois, Mr» Hoot would be in Holland that day nr the next,
Mr» layton said that the telegrams about Typhus contributions had been sent to Mr* Balfour, who had to get the concurrence cf the Chancellor of the Exchequer before despatching them» Since sending them to Mr, Balfour he had heard no ncre. He male no attempt to suggest in. what currency the payments should be male;.
Mo ns 1 eu r Mant o me referred t© the recent note on Montenegro which had been received through the mediation of Signor Tittoni.
He had spoken to Commendatoro Anzilotti who did not think that the fast that Signor Tittoni had sent it meant that ho desired that it should be placed on the Agenda for tho Council* If he did so desire, due notice was required, as the Serbian Government must be ask6d to send a Representative,
Mo ns1eur Monns t spoke of the date of the Financial
Conference» Spa had been postponed to the 6th July0 We oo/uld
not leave the date of the Brussels Conference uncertain any longer.
We had shown every regard for the convenience cf the interested
.parties/
-3-
parties, and. must now fix a date. The difficulty was that we had Spa on the 6th July, the Council on the 27th July, and it appeared that material arrangements made it difficult for "both the Council and the Brussels Conference to meet simultaneously.
(Ur- Layton disagreed with this point. The Secretary General ashed whether there would not be questions for discussion at San Sebastian which closely concerned the Eooncnic Section.')
He, therefore, asked the meeting to consider whether if it were possible to arrange it, the Counoil should not meet at a date earlier than the 27th July, and the Brussels Conference be held cn or about the 23rd July. Monsieur Bourgeois might perhaps at Monday's Meeting suggest the Conference being put off till that date. Tho Secretary General said that the Council would then have to meet on about the 15th July. The difficulty was that the Council ought to consider any subjects which were to appear cn the Agenda for the Assembly Meeting, which in turn ought to be sent out to all Members of the League before the 1st August. This meant sending out the Agenda for the Council meeting early in July,
Commondatcro Anzilotti and Dr, van Hamel pointed out that it would bo very difficult for tho Jurists Commission to place a Report before tho Council, if its Meeting were put forward. They could hardly tako less than five weok3 for their work» If they did not finish before August, their Report would have to be sent direct to the Members of the League. Dr, van Hamel thought that it was somewhat dangerous to try and alter the date of the Meeting which had been fixed for the 27th July, Ur, Layton said that in any case the Brussels Meeting could not be delayed till August. One of the Members invited for June had already resigned.
The Secretary General remarked that President V/ilson had never replied to the telegram which had been sent to him.
We could if necessary find a way of approaching President Wilson. Ought this to be done? Dr.van Hamel thought- it certainly should beat tempt-ed/
■
attempted. It was suggested that an official telegram might he sent by the Council at its Meeting, and that this telegram might he published. This, he thought, would give the impression of a conflict between the Council and President Wilson, and we ought to do it privately hut the general sense of the Meeting was opposed to this. The Secretary General said that it was clear that we must get an answer between San Sebastian and the dispatch of the Agenda, and there would probably be another emergency Meeting of the Council before then.

IN EES SECRETARY GENERAL1 S ROOM, ON WEDNESDAY, THE 23rd JUNE, 1920.
Present; The Secretary General.
Monsieur Mantoux.
Dr. ran Eame1.
Monsieur Cclban,.
Monsieur Comert.
Mr * Baber.
The Secretary-General said that he had seen Finnish and Swedish representatives in connection with the dispute about the Inland Islands. Eis impression was that the Fins were afraid that the Swedes were anxious tc have the matter settled by the League before .Finland was a Member, and that therefore Finland would not rooeive equal treatment. Ee had assured then that they would receive absolutely equal and impartial treatment.
With regard to the date of the Speoial Meeting of the Council, he considered that the best plan was that it should bo held in London on the 5th, 6th or Yth July, if Monsieur Bourgeois would consent to come. The alternative proposal that it should be hell in Brussels and be attended for Great Britain by the Erime Minister he considered undesirable, as it would make the Meeting of the Counoil appear a side-show to the Meetings cf the Supreme Council of the Allies. There was general agreement that this was the right view, and that Mr, Balfour would be more acceptable to Swedish and Finnish opinion than any other British representativec
With regard to the method of dealing with the dispute, the
Secretary-General considered that th^ Counoil should; first propose
to the parties that theystrould aoo-ept a Commission to enquire and
report tho Members to be seleoted by the League from among persons
/chosen
~ ~
chosen from three impartial States, c.g. Switzerland, Spain and Czecho-Slovakia, and that the parties should undertake in advance to accept the findings of this Commission. If they refused to give such an undertaking, the Council should then as an alternative propose that the Commission of Enquiry should report with recommendations to the Council at a later date. In cither case, the Commission would endeavour to settle the matter hy mediation, and to secure agreement between the parties.
Lira Colban said that the parties were not likely to accept the Secretary General's first plan, unless very strict instructions wore given to tho Commission on certain matters, such as the Military use of the Islands, etc,
Dr, van Hamel also objected to the Secretary General 'a first plan, as he said it would moan that a complete system of Government, including a series of Treaties on such subjects as the Protection of Minorities, etc,, would have to be imposed by tho League. It was much better to endeavour to secure agreement by means of mediation between the parties in accordance with the Secretary General's second alternative. He pointed out that this is not a dispute which can bo settled by reference to existing principles of lav;, or even of justice. It is not, therefore, strictly speaking either a juridical or an arbitral dispute.
Hr. Colban repeated his view that there waa grant danger of both parties refusing tho Secretary General's first plan, and that it would be better to avoid this by merely appointing a Commission of Enquiry to report to the Council in the first instance, leaving the Council at a subsequent Meeting to make the settlement itself. Possibly under the threat of such settlement by the Council, the parties would reach previous agreement, Dr. van Hamel pointed out that in a parallel case, Belgium and Holland both had refused to bind themselves to .accept a decision in advance with regard to the recent du dispute between thorn, when they had boon invited to do so,	The Secretary General said
that after hearing the discussion, ho still maintained his view that
it/
3~
it would be wiser to endeavour to induoe the parties to accept a Commission whose deoisions should he binding, hut that if one or both refused, the second plan oould still he adopted without prejudicing its chances of success. In answer to a question by the Secretary-General, Mr. Golban said that historioall# the Aaland Islands had, until 1809, been a provinoe of Finland for administra tire purposes, but that then and no?/ about only four per cent, of its population were Finnish,
Mrn Bahor raised the question of Typhus, and a short discussion occurred on the means of finding the necessary money« Monsieur Mantoux raised a question put to him by the Bolivian Minister on the question of Tacna Arica. The Seoretary-General said that it would be better for the League not to issue an official dementi to the statement that it would disinterest itself in the settlement of this dispute, but that this would oertainly be done by the Bolivians themselves.

THE 7th JULY. 1920,
PrsssrniJi The Senratary General Dr, Ditch0 Mr« Cl oil an Dr, van Earel Monsieur Mantoux Monsieur Haas Hr o Malr»
Mr, Walters (Secretary)
ffho Secretary-General referred to a visit which ho had received 'this morning from Messrs. Snake 11 and Donner; the former of whom would represent Finland at the Council on Fridayo He gathered that they proposed to claim that while the Military Status of the Island was admittedly as International question its Political Status was purely a domestic question and as such not within the competence of the Oounoilc
Mr« Pollan, Dr» ran SameI and M« Mantcux expressed the view that the whole Aaland Islands question was essentially one question and the proper course was fvr the Council at the opening of the discussion to consider whether or not the whole question was of domestic or international concerns Having settled this they could if necessary proceed to deal with demilitarisation and perhaps Beach a permanent settlement on this 9
Mr, Qolban pointed out that the question was extremely complicated. Although Finland had pledged herself to eroot no
/fortifications
HELD
WEDNESDAY

fortifications on the islands if they were assigned to her it was just conceivable that if they were Swedish territory she would actually prefer to see them fortified»
The Secretary-General said that the Finnish Representstires had giren him some interesting information regarding the Russian claim; when Finland declared herself autonomous, the Russian Government recognised her right to do st. Simultaneously the Aaland Islands declared for union with Sweden and the Russian Government therefore declined to regard them as oovered by the recognition of Finnish independence. They now claimed the Islands as part of Russia*
The Meetings would begin at 10»45 a^n» on Friday 9th July at St» James1 falace. The Secretary-General thought Mr, Balfour would ash Monsi&ur Bourgeois to take tno chair during the discussion of the /¿aland Islands1 quest!on0 The Finnish and Swedish Representatives would he waiting in another rocm» The Council would immediately ash for tho Swede to join them and thereafter hw hoped would at once ash the Finnish Representative to do the same. He understood from "the Finns that if they were not placed on equality with the Swedes they would leave the Council* In any case they would very likely argue that the matter was not urgent and ought to be left until after the Assembly Meeting at which they hoped they would become Members of the League and so be able to oall on Artiole I($ of the Covenant»
He hoped the work would be got through in two day a and a public Meeting held on Saturday afternoon. There was no ether question to go on the agenda hut he would talk to the Members informally regarding the Typhus contributions» In this matter he "thought "there should bs no publicity before
/the
-3-
the San Sebastian Meeting. The question of money for Dr. Nansen1s work was also in a Dad way. The British Government had taken a disastrous point of view on the matter hat he had great hopes of getting this reversed.
It seemed to him that the moral of the two thing3 was that the league of Rations was a had body to bo responsible for raising or for spending large funds. Its aetior should he by way of encouraging the Governments to support the Red Gross or other similar institutions.
For San Sebastian we should leave here about tho Btth, he hvped to get through everything within 10 days.
Mr. Oolban snid that he would havo subjects for the Council which could net he ready for San Sebastian, e.g.
The acceptance of the provisions cf some Minority Treaties (two of these were provisionally on the San Sebastian agenda). Tho League could not deal with these until Article lt5 had been complied with; till then we could not take cognizance of any Treaty. The situation cf Danzig and final decision of the Eupon question'.would both come up soon after San Sebastian. Dr. Van Hamel said the question of the Permanent Court probably would do the sarno. It was therefore agreed that it wculc. probably be necessary tc arrange a Council Meeting for about the beginning of September.
Dr, Tan Hamel said the news in that mornings paper from the Eague was of great interest. It showed that Mr. Root had carried the Gommittoo with him and that they had dacicLed on a scheme for the election of judges which vrould fit in admirably with the organisation of the League.
There wore two conflicting proposals, that of Baron Desoampa who wanted to have an election by the existing High Tribunal and Mr. Roob:s scheme for election by tha
/Council
-4-
Oounoil and the Assembly, The latter he thought a most excellent plan and particularly so seeing that it was an American who proposed it.,
The Committee’s Report oculd hardly he ready by San Sebastian. It should be scot as soon as it was roc.-i.ted to all Members of the League. Of course the Counoil could make on it ary commc_b it wished«,
Monsieur Mantor-x asked whether the discussion of B & 0 Mandates would be undertaken at San Sebastian, he quoted a recent Article from a French Uewapaper showing the Confusion on the matter which existed in the public rcincL The gccretary^Qenera^ said it depended ~n what happened Spa. Efforts were being made to get the matter advanced there but ho did not personally expect that much would bo done and if not the Council would hare to sit down to work it cut-, Monsieur Haas said that he had been recently in Strasbourg, Prague and Breslau and that the relations between the River Commissions and the League were generally st satisfactory, so was the working of the River Commissions themselves except, for the moment, that of tho Rhine Commission0 Answering a question he sail that the River Commissions are permanent organisations except for the two existing Danube Commissions which function until the new Danube Convention which is shortly to he drawn up& Tho establishment of the general convention provided for in Article 33C of the Treaty would not affect the relations be tv/o on the League cf Rations and the Commissions, 2e had had no difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relations even in tho oaso of the Gorman Delegations who showed every desire to pay attention to the League’s point of view; this was perhaps natural in view of the great powers given to the League by the Treaty in
/this
this connection
Mr« Mair asked whether if Spa broke up this would affect the opening of the Brussels Conference.- The The Secretary-general saicL he thought the latter must go ahead in any case.
Dr, ffitobe said he had recently visited in Paris fifteen International Bureaim of which no less than nine proved to he defunct. This was due to two causes, first, lack of funds and second, the fact that they did not feel ready to work yet with the German?? and preferred to hibernateB Only two o± three were at all flourishing, amongst which he mentioned particularly the Association Internationale de Is Route,.
The Seoretary-General said he hoped two questions in particular might be discussed at next weeks Meeting

The Secretary General saia That he felt that tho decision reached on the ¿.aland Islands question was "better than could have "been hoped, not only ho cause the two arrested Islanders
had Loon released, which undoubted!
.y was
owing to the intervention
of., the League, "but "because tho development cf the Polish-Russian situation seonod to point to a general Conference "being held
before lens on tho Baltic question and the honndari
cx Hus so. a
and Germany» If this were so, the status of tho Aalana Islands was bound to acme up, a^d if the Council had definitely committed itself, there would have been difficulties in re-opening the matter with Russia as a party to the discussion» Reference to a Jurists Commission had, therefore, he thought, turned cut to bo a wise plan, and he rather hoped that the Commission's Report would not come in too soona
It had been definitely decided not to postpone the Finanoial Conference, but to hold it on the 23rd July» He feared that the attitude taken up by Monsieur Bourgeois in his letter to Monsieur Millcrand as to the Council waiting for Spa decisions might, in view of what had happened, put us in a rather difficult positions
It seemed/
It seemed that we should have to hold the Conference without any definite settlement on Reparations having been reached,,
Monsieur Monne t h-ad gone to Spa to make a desperate attempt at getting a„ definite answer from the Supreme Council hut he feared that there were small hopes of success*
He wished to postpone the intended discussion on communication of information to-Members of the league till a Meeting at which Monsieur Moxinet could he present*
As regards San Sebastian, the idea seemed to he that the Council should stay there 1C days, and not work too violently.
He had had a letter from Mr* Hammarskjoeld, saying that the Hague Committee:s Report was not likely to be ready by the 27th July, but that Monsieur de Lapradelle, who was to report to the Council on behalf of the Committee, had suggested that he should go down to San Sebastian to inform the Members of the Council of the general lines of the proposed scheme, ask privately for their views about it, and then return to the Hague, where a final meeting of the Committee would be held,, He thought that this was a bad plan, and had written to Commendatore Anzilotti, saying that he thought the right method was to get the Councils assent at San Sebastian to the scheme being circulated immediately on completion to all Members of the League; the Council:s own discussion >m the scheme to take place at its September Meeting*
Monsiear Mantoiix raised the point whether the Armenian question might or ought tu come up again at San Sebastian* The Supreme Council had stated that they were going to try the United States, and if that' failed, consult further with the Council cf the League* Ought the Supreme Council or the Council of the League to open the question whether that further consultation should not now take place, It would he disgraceful if the question were dropped* We know from the papers that the appeal to the United States has failed, though we have not been officially informed'of this., He would net be disinclined to send a short note on the subject to the Supreme
Council/
Council» The Secretary General said that he thought that the Supreme Council wore waiting for the information which tho Council had stated was necessary, regarding access to the sea, which they could not give until President Wilson had defined the boundaries, which he had agreed to do.
Monsieur Comert said that he wished to propose that a Comii't'tGe should he appointod to take charge of the Official Journal. There were so many documents that the Member off his Section in charge of it could not know what to print, or whether he had all the documents that might require printing. The Committee should be very small, and should he suggested, consist of l) a Member of the Information Section, 2) a Member of the Leg*l Section,
3)	a Précis Writer, and 4) Major Buxton or Dr. Dixon, The Secretary-General said that the ideal thing would be for each Section to decide what they want printed. This was clearly the business of the Head of the Section. As regards Counoil Documents, these all passed through the Drafting Committee, and that Committee could say what ought to be put in, Monsieur Mantoux aBked for a definition of the scope of the 'Journal; what information exactly is it intended to convey to its readers? The Secretary-General said that it should contain almost exclusively things circulated to the Council and to the Members of the League. It was agreed that the Secretary General should send a circular to Hoads of Sections, calling theix attention to the necessity of seeing that the Offioial Journal received every necessary document, and also should instruct the Irafting Committee to consider every document that passed through it, whether it was for tho Journal or not.
There wa3 a good deal of discussion at this Meeting regarding the co-ordination of Interior Services, particularly with reference to the rapid and complete circulation of papers, and to the organisation necessary to ensure that documents required should be quickly available apart from the copy entered in the Registry. Do final conclusions were reached.

Mr. Walters (Secretary).
The Seeretary-General referred to the postponement of the
Pinanc ial Conference until after the 15th Se ptember. The reasons
for and against acceding to the Supreme Council's request were nicely
balanced, and he was glad that it had not fallen to him to decide.
He wondered whether it seemed, for instance, to the Pov.rers which had
been heutral during the war, that something useful could have been
done had no postponement taken place cr whether they thought that the
fact that the responsibility of Germany vis t vis the Allies remained
a
indeterminate would be/fatal obstacle. It was o¿early difficult for Monsieur Bourgeois, in view of the attitude publicly adopted by him, to refuse to agree to the postponement, the suggestion for which, as he understood, had emanated from the Italians, and had been supported by the Belgians.
The summons for the Assembly had been issued for the loth Hovembcr, at Geneva, in accordance with president Wilson's message. He understood that some cf the Swiss were net quite happy so to accomodation and facilities of different kinds, but that they meant to do all that they could to make the Meeting a success.
With reference to the discussion on certain internal matters of last week, he had felt that no definite conclusions had been reached, end had asked Mr. Celban and Mr. Walters to submit suggestions.
Mr. Layton/
-2~
Mr. Layton referred, to the- effect of the Brussels decision on the question of the uso of the Economic Weapon.
The Secretary-General said that this was a serious question. He understood from Coirmendatore Anzilotti that Signor Tittoni was opposed on grounds of economy to the appointments of another Conference or Commission. There was no reason to suppose that ho ohjectod to
on principle/the question being discussed, but it seemed that the
general attitude of the Italian Authorities was that while they
naturally felt that they must be represented at every important
Conference, they were unwilling to incur the expense of sending
Delegates at present. However, we should see what Signor TittoniTs
¡attitude was at San Sebastian»
Sir Herbert Ames said that as a result of his visit to
America, he felt pretty hopeful about the United States eventually
coming in. If a Democratic. President were elected, there would
proh^biTr he still a Republican Majority in the Senate, and so the
old, hopeless fight would drag on. If a Republican, there would be
the
En attempt to get/ Treaty through with modifications, but of course be could not say whether those modifications would be of an acceptable nature or not. He had had to explain that we could not spend Honey on Propaganda in America. The League to Enforce Peace „did its best, but it was very timid. In Canada feeling was very favourable to the league, and Canadian Journals would, he felt sure, give plenty ox space to information we sent them.
The Secretary-General referred to the scheme about which Senor Edwards, the Chilean Minister, had recently talked to Monsieur Comert, and which had been circulated to Under-Secretaries General and Directors, with a note which he had written on it.
^enor Edwards had suggested tha^liis should be discussed at the Assembly. The Scheme was to have two Councils to deal with the Political problems of the League, one in America, and one in Europe.
The American; /
The American one would, presumably, include Canada, while far Eastern Members would, be represented cn the European one* The question was a very big one, and he would like to knew what those present thought of it when they had seen the document's , Meanwhile, he suggested that it was unacceptable in its present form, being based on the idea that a conflict in one Continent would not be of interest to the nations of another, which was a great mistake, but it might prove a workable

objections to it, would make it easier for the United States to come
in, and that it was justified to some extent by the fact that the Monroe Doctrine was specific ally mentioned in the Covenant.
In the course of the discussion which followed, Mr* Colbsn urged that there was danger in encouraging the formation of groups within the league, enjoying special privileges. It might, for instance, have the effect on the Scandinavian countries of causing them to combine for political advantage in matters connected with the league. On the other hand, it was urged that fa) it would be better for such combinations to be made openly rather than secretly, (b) that in themselves they were not undesirable, and (c) the plan as modified in the Secretary-General's note was only one for dealing with disputes and difficulties and was not intended to apply in the ordinary carrying out of the league's business.
Dr. van Hamel said that ho had had a visit from a
Representative of Georgia which desired to become a Member of the
League. He wished to put forward for eensideration the question
a lead to the Assembly in the
matter of/
whether the Council ought tc give
lead to the
-4-
matter of the various applications. If they did not do so, would it be best for the Assembly to decide the matter on its first Ueeting? It would have to appoint a Committee to male all sorts of enquiries. T he S e cr o t ar y- Go non- a 1 said that it seemed, to him that the Assembly would appoint its Committee at the very beginning
of the Meeting, and the Committee should be able tc
)ort bofoie
the Meeting closed. There should be ready for its consideration at once a historical statement of the position of the States making application, and of com-so the State itself must be prepared to give guarantees. He did not wish to run any risk of antagonism between the Council and the Assembly. This was a 'purely Assembly question, and it was to be feared that if it reached the Assembly with a recommendation of the Council, the former might bo influenced tat her to reject than to accept whatever the Council might suggest.

Monsieur Mantoux.
Mr. Walters (Secretary)
Tho Soorotary-General said that ho thought that tho Mooting at San Sebastian had boon vory satisfactory on tho whole, Ono subjoct on which some difficulties had scorned likely was that of the relations be two on tho Council and the Assembly, but satisfactory conclusions had been reached, and we should circulate shortly to all Manbors a small collection cf documents on the general questions involved* He had also received from Monsieur Bourgeois privately a memorandum on the subject which expressed tho view that tho Secretariat was tho only connecting link botwoen tho two bodies,.and that proposals, otc., from tho Council could only come before the Assembly through tho intermediary of the Secretariat. While fully agreeing with this, he was not quite so happy about a further point made by,Monsieur Bourgeois, who held the opinion that in spite of tho above view, on account of its constitutional position, tho Secretariat should obtain tho approval of the Council to all proposition which it intended, to put to the Assembly. This opinion ho fQfcsidorod . unacceptable (ll it would' limit the authority of the Socretari vis a via tho Assembly, (2) it was likely to arouso feelings of jealousy in tho Assembly with .regard to tho Council, Tho Mooting generally agreed that it might in practice often ho udeful to act
in accordance with Monsieur Bourge ois’s second point, "but that it ought not to bo a theoretioal rule, Tho Council ought to bo informed cf everything tut not nocossarily asked for its approval.
Ur. Colban said that circumstances might arise during tho Meeting of the Assembly which would require a Meeting of the Council; he thought there was no theoretical difficulty in tho Council sitting.as a separate body during the Meeting, though in practice this might not be a wise arrangement., - Sir Herbert Ames asked whether the Representative on the Council would in most oases be one of the three Delegates of his Government.
The Secretary-General said he thought that this would generally be the case* The British Government* so far as he knew had not made up its mind, but would probably ask Mr. Balfour to go. In any case, the Council could be fully formed, by a meeting of the senior delegates of each of the 8 countries Members of the Council. This was an important point of theory; in practice he agreed that if the regular Members waro there, a genuine contact between the two bodies would be more easily established It was mentioned that the Prime Ministers of Greece, Canada and Australia were likoly tc be present.
As regards the next Council Meeting, the Secrotary-General said he had hoped that Eupen and Ualmcdy would be the cnly important question. It seemed, however, not improbable that the report of the Jurists Commission about the Aaland Islands might be ready about ten days or so beforo, and if so, the Council would perhaps be wise to deal with the matter. If they did so, they would probably not do more than appoint a Committee to try and help on an amioablo settlement of the difficulties between Sweden and Finland.
After that there would be one more Mooting in Brussels, the last one before the Assembly.
Sir Herbert Amos
said that thoro
•3~
was a question of the next 'budget being takon beforo the Assembly met, It might bo possible to submit it t» the October Meetir.g; but only in very incomplete form; the Assembly would then have throe budgets to deal with.
The Seore!-ar;y-General said that a result Of holding tha last Meeting at Brussels would probably be that Monsieur Hymans would hold the Presidency of the Assembly until that body elected its President. There would be four Vice-Presidents who would form a Committee to nominate the Members of the various subcommittees. It was to be hoped that every Delegate would bo on at least one sub-Committoo.
After leaving San Sebastian, he had visited Genova with other Members ox the Secretariat, They had looked first for a hall for the Assembly, and had found, and decided to take, one which oould seat about 1,000 on the floor, and had two galleries running round it. Its only drawback was that there wore not enough other rooms in the building to form offioos and Committee rooms. With the help of the Geneva Government, which is bearing all the expenses of providing and furnishing a hall and offices for the Assembly, it was decided to take the Picard Pictet building as offices for the Assembly. This building had once been offered as a permanent office for the Secretariate It would not do for that, but would do excellently for offices for the Assembly. Its 80 rooms would suffice for all sub-Committocs and for one offioe room for every Delegation. This would be most helpful from the point of view of circulation of papers, Press
arrangements were not yet settled, but one floor
ox one
hh ,■> V-
,cr xu
Hotel adjoining the hall was being kept until Monsieur Comert and Mr. Mair had been able to inspect it.
It had then been necessary to look for a permanent office for the Secretariat. After seeing several places, they had
/finally

finally deoiled that the Hotel National would bo musk the best.
It stands in its own ground and has about 200 rooms, and Is now being completed as an hotel, bat can be completed as an office» Options can be seoured over three on four strips of adjoining ground* It Would have to be bought outright, but payment oould be Spread over a term of years. They counted on having the first throe floors ready on the 1st November; this gavo about 12C rooms.
It included two big rooms capable of holding at'least 200 people, which oould be (1) the Library (2) the meeting place of International congresses of different hinds. V?e ought to aim new at getting all such Meetings held at Geneva as far as possible.
It would probably be necessary to get by far the greater part of the Secretariat settled in Geneva by the 1st November,
They would have to bo gathered into 120 rooms, and might bo rather crowded at first. Perhaps the majority of the Library oould stay behind, and thus one big room would be available for any use it was required to put it to.
As regards the personal arrangements of tho Secretariat, he had appointed a citizen of Geneva, Monsieur Patio, to ropresent the Secretariat during the installation period, in all negotiations with the Geneva Government; also to be, with a small bureau under him, sole agent for finding housing accommodation* Thus ha hoped to prevent unnecessary competition and raising of prices-. It was said that prices were now rising, and accordingly he had written to the Government of Geneva saying that if this were so, allowances would have to be made accordingly to the Members of the Secretariat, and thi3 would involve bringing the matter before the Council.
Ho hoped that this letter would induce the Government of Geneva to do something in the matter if it were in its power to do so,
Monsieur Mantoux said that Monsieur Patio ought to have the power to boycott house-owners v/ho deliberately raised prices against
/the
-5
the league, It was pointed cut that he would automatically have this power if all Members of the Secretariat worked through him, "but ho could not have it if they used other intermediaries.
The Secretary-General said that he proposed that subsistence allowances should he given to all Members of the Secretariat until they hare found a place of residence, but that such allowance should in any case cease at the end of the Assembly Meeting. As regards this and other details, including the question of moving all effects, Sir Herbert Ames would be ready tc give any information in his power to any Members of the Secretariat. A general memorandum was also being circulated. Sir Herbert Ames mentioned that it would be necessary for Directors to say as soon as possible what accommodation their respective sections would require.
Ir> van Kamel referred to the question of the Polish crisis..
He thought it ought to be before the League, The Secretary-General said he saw nc way in whioh it was likely to come before the League. He thought we might be put in a false position if we now intervened. At an earlier stage it might nave been well if tho matter had come before tho League when tho Soviet Government was protesting its anniety for peace and before the Polish Army had made much headway in its advance towards Moscow, Ko Member of the League had then tried to cause the League to intervene. Theie was no analogy with the events of 1914, when a state of peace
existed with settled Governments and frontiers. Dr,van Hamel said it was not intervention he wanted, but the question ought to be before the Loaguo, The Council ought to be mootinge per-haps daily. Even were it known that its Members would probably not agree, that
was no reason for it not mooting. The Scoretary-General said ho should agree if the purpose of the League wore tho making of pcaoe, but it really was tho preservation of peace once it had too: mad«.
Mr. Colb an thought that tho references in official eta tenon, jj tho
/British
-6-
British'Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to the bearing of .Article 19 cn the situation should bo circulated to all Members of tho league for their information and consideration* It constituted an interpretation of the Covenant in a very important matter.
Ho -.asked what if tho Government of one of the Members of the Longue not represented on the Counoil exorcised it3 right of bringing the matter to the attention of the Council, under Article 11?
He and-Dr.van Hamel thought this would be e very good thing for the League,, and that, for instance, tho French and British Governments would be glad it, and could give recognition to tho Soviet Government through tho Loaguo, which they could hardly do if left ■ alone. Monsieur Mantoux put the case of very harsh terms being offered by the Soviet .to Poland. In that oase the British, or Some other Government, -might wish to step in and to base their action un Article 10* If so, it would be impossible to avoid, calling the Counoil, as action taken under the Covenant must bo taken in accordance with the constitutional procedure laid down by the . Covenant. Tho Secretary~General said that this was ono case in which the matter might properly be within the sphere of the League, and there was another which he would not exclude as impossible, viz. if peace were made as a result of the Minsk negotiations ur terms to which objection could no.t be taken under tho Covenant.
Once such a pence had been made, and the Eastern frontier of Poland delimited, Article 1C, and more especially Article 17, would automatically come into operation.

of a Direotors Meeting held In the Secretary General’s room •n Wednesday, August 85th, 192C. at 3.30 p.m.

Sir Eerbort Ames
Mr. Colban
Mr, Mair
Dr, EUdson
Mr. Walters (Seorotary)
The Seoretary-General said that negotiations about the Hotel National were still going cn. Wo were being asked to pay-more and to pay in a shorter time than it was originally estimated; probably the Council would approve ef our agreeing to this. It was to be hoped that if no strikes occurred we might have got on as far as we had counted on by November 1st.
Ho referred to the circular he had sent round about the Agenda for the Council Meetings of September and October,
The original idea of th® September Meeting was that it should only last 3 days; private meetings being hold on the Thursday and Friday and a public one on Saturday. The question now arose whether the Jurists Report on the Aaland Islands which might be ready by September 5th should be dealt with at the Paris Meeting. M. Bourgeois1 view was that it should be, The Socretary-General himself thought that there were serious practical difficulties and had written to Senor Quinones de Leon to that effect. The Members of the Council would only have the Report by about 12th September; it would also of course have to go to the Representatives of Sweden and Finland, It was understood that the Swedish Government desired a deoision urgently but that the Finns might ask for time to study the Report and
[consult their Goremnsat» If ono sido asked for lelay it would bo very
difficult to refuse and indeod the time allowed seemed too short
•to enable the matter to bo properly considered0 If Sweden opposed
postponement it would become a question of procedure to bo decided by
majority* He did not think that .Finland had anything to gain by post«
tuning the consideration of the matter 'until she had bcoome a Member r
ox the League* The Council had made no difference in this respect Ibotwoen Sweden and Finland *
Ee hoped therefore that the procedure at Paris would be that the Council would take note of the report at a formal meeting at which tho Swedish and Finnish representatives would he invited to attend and decide to doal with tho report at the Brasses moetinga
Apart from tho As,land Islands question there remained Supon and Malmedy, some Saar questions and some points put up by the Finareial Director*
Mr* Oolban said that the Greco-Bulgarian Inter Immigration Treaty ought to be dealt with in September as by its terms two Commissioners are to be appointed by the Council within throe months of the coming into force of the Treaty and this had happened a month ago* An important question of principio was here involved; can wo take stops to carry out duties assigned to the League by a Treaty later in date than January 10th 1920 which has not boon registered with tho Secretariat?
Dr„ Hudson, thought that tho Council could decido its action in such a caso, making provision that such decision should not bo put into effect until tho Treaty Lad been registered and published and so become valid from the point of view of the League*
Mr, Oolban....
Mr o Goil)an had got the Greek Minister to telegraph to Athens
asking that he might be instructed to present authentic copy of the Treaty in question for registration and publication.
Other cases might arise, e.g. Austrian peace Treaty and Czechoslovak Minorities Treaty. He thought the Counoil should not consider them until they were registered. The simplest plan would be for the French Foreign Office to send them for registration and he had in mind to talk to M. Bourgeois about it during his forthcoming visit to Paris. As regards Hr. Hudsonrs point there was the practical difficulty that we have no official knowledge of a Treaty which has not been sent to us for registration.
Commendatore Anzllotti said he was inclined to agree in theory with Dr, HudsonTs view.
The Secretary General was also inclined to agree but asked in such a case who would put the Treaty before the Council? As it had been pointed out, the Secretariat would have no knowledge of it; must then some Member of the Council bring it up?
Hr, Hudson said that any Member of the Council could bring . ... it up or the Secretariat c-ould do so if the Treaty had been officially sent to it for information.
Mr. Colban thought this a dangerous view. If the Treaty were officially sent to us ought we not to consider ourselves free at once to register and publish it, whether or not it were specifically said that it was sent for that purpose? It was very undesirable to let action be taken on a Treaty before it had been registered. In particular the matter of publicity had to be remembered. The Treaty having been registered the Oonnoil could treat it as perfectly valid and yet not necessarily accept any duty assigned to it thereby. He thought in the present case it would probably be unnecessary to decide the point as we might hope to receive the Treaty in question for registration, As regards the Polish Treaty, the Secretariat had put this before the Council, taking it fr'om the publications of the British Foreign Office; that however, was entered into
before.,
before January 10th. What was really desirable was that one or more of the Great Powers should ¿-et into the habit of automatically sending every Treaty for registration. To do so would have no political implications and the other Signatories could not object*
The Secretary General said he agreed tint Mr. Colban should , when he saw M. Bourgeois, explain the practical difficulty and suggest that the French. Foreign Office would be the most natural channel for Treaties arising out of the Paris Conference to reach us by« As regards the GFree* -Bulgarian Treaty he hoped this would reach us from Athens« Clearly the rule to aim at was for the Council not to take action on any Treaty which has not been registered.
Mr. Colban said as regards the actual appointing of Commissioners, nc suggestion had yet been mado to the Council but he had thought out a plan.
The Secretary General referred to the Assembly Meeting regarding which he had sent out a circular asking the views of Under Secretary Generals and Directors. When the answers came in it would be a good thing to have a Committee to keep an eye on the various questions. He thought that when the names of the Delegates had been received we should try and work out to some extent before hand the Membership of the various committees. He thought that there would bo about 100 Delegates in all and near 20 Committees so it would probably be possible for every Delegate to be on some Committee.
Sir Herbert Ames suggested that a small Whors Who of the delegates should be prepared showing what posts eto they had held and it wTas decided that as names of delegates came in they should be communicated tc the Information Section who should try and supply short details about them.
Dr. Hudson raised the question of the use of the Spanish language at the Assembly. At Washington and Genoa a daily record of the Conference was printed in three languages«,
5
Ho protest was made against this. The French and. English versions were circulated by 10 o'clock A.M. on the clay after each Meeting; the Spanish version less regularly and as a rule less quickly.
Mr. Mair suggested as an alternative that summaries should be produced of say 1000 words in at any rate Spanish, Italian, German and Japanese. The Information Section could see to this if the printing arrangements allowed of it.
The Secretary General said that the question primarily concerned the full Assembly Meetings, If possible the Committee Meetings should have nc Process Verbal,
Mr. Colban said ho was, in principle, against the printing of a Spanish Daily Eecord. To do so would encourage the use of Spanish in speeches at the Meeting; this meant two interpretations as well as many speeches which were not at all understood by the majority of the delegates, and would lead to muoh loss of interest. Most South Americans spoko French admirably; and he felt sure that it would be claimed that Portuguese should also enjoy the same privilege.
Dr, Hudson said that he thought it was sure to bo demanded by the Spaniards. Some twenty countries at Washington had claimed it and after a debate lasting a whole afternoon they had an overwhelming majority. The Italian and some other delegations nado the same claim but this was not put to the vote.
The Secretary General thought that this was very likely to happen but it would be better to make the Assembly take the initiative rather than the Secretariat, The question, therefore, was what action should ao take before hand - should we make preparations to meet the extra work or should we say that we had not expected this and could hardly do it at this meeting but would do so at the next Assembly? After discussion he astced Sir Herbert Ames to find out from the International labour Office what the extra cost and Staff involved was likely to be.
6 -
A further discussion took place as regards the execution of necessary printing work at Geneva. It was decided that Mj Cemert and Mr. Mair during their visit there should in conjunction with gr. Huston enquire into the best method of arranging for this.
The Secretary General said it was evident that the Secretariat Committee ought to get to work as soon as possible and certainly not later than at the return of M. Comert and Mr. Mair. He said he would be away for about three weeks from the 30th of this month. Commendatore Anzilotti would take on his work until M. Monnet returned on about the 7th or 8th September* He would if necessary sign letters and contracts etc. with the Hotel Company as soon as the Legal Section had passed them.
Sir Herbert Ames said he hnped the Legal Section would be able to furnish its opinions by September 1st, that Section ought also to see a telegram we should be sending about that time giving our final decision on the terms offered.
The Secretary General said he had received a telegram from Senor Quinones de Leon to the effect that M. Bourgeois himself thought that it would be difficult t® control the publication of the Court project as soon as it had gone to the Members and therefore it would be best for the Secretariat to publish it at a given date after it had been offieially dispatched. He thought that we were bound to publish in view of this. As to date of publication he suggested the 15th September which would be before the Council Meeting and just two months before the Assembly. As to the form, it should be a supplement to the Official Journal and v/ould include the Councils letter to the Governments.
The Meeting then selected the colour for the cover of the Treaty Series of the Official Journal, deciding upon an autumnal brown which tho printer had explained would not change colour when it faded.

Mr. WaLTISS - Secretary.
Oommendatore xNLILOTTI said there was not much to report since the last meeting. The meeting of the Council in Paris was now definitely fixed for Septan be r the 16 th. It was hoped that the Aland Islands report would be ready by September 5th, though we are not entirely certain of this. Even if it were ready it seemed likely that the Council would not take a final decision on the case at the Paris meeting.
The provisional agenda for the meeting had been submitted to Senor gUINONES de LEON and been circulated to the sections.
The former had not yet sent any renly.
He asked whether the Directors had any suggestions they wished to make.
MA, GOLD nil said, as regards the points 1, 3 & 4, the rapporteurs had been finally settled. It was agreed at San Sebastian that M. da CUNBa should report on Eupen and Malmedy and
and Monsieur BOURGEOIS had agreed to report on the Greco-Bulgarian Treaty. As regards Item 5, the position is not yet quite clear.
The Secretariat had not yet received the Treaties concerned for registration, but there was reason to think that M. Bourgeois would arrange this with the Frenoh Foreign Office in time.	He had
prepared the neoessary memorandum for the Austrian Treaty, the Co echo-Slovakian Treaty and the Bulgarian Treaty. It was suggested that the Italian representative should act as rapporteur for this item. It was not known yet who this would be , but he would go and speak to the Italian Ambassador in Paris.
Commendator ANZILOTTI said v/ith regard to the agenda, the oeoretary-General had asked Signor Tittoni whether he desired his resolution regarding monopolies etc. to be dealt with at Paris or at Brussels, but no answer had yet arrived. He personally anticipated that Senor Tittoni would not wish the matter to come up till Brussels.
Mr. COLBAN said it had been originally proposed that the Counoil should deal at Paris with the constitution of Dantzig.
This had been received from Sir B. TOWER, but the Secretary-General considered that the whole question was closely bound up with that of the Treaty to be negotiated between Dantzig and Poland, and ought therefore to be postponed till October.	A note to this
effect would be laid before the Council at Paris and as it touched on some important political questions, it might possibly give rise to a discussion.
There was another delicate question he wished to mention:
We had circulated for information to the Council a complaint by the German Government against the Saar Basin Governing Commission, and
r>
at the same time had ashed M. RAULl' for his observations upon it. These had new been received - they must certainly he circulated, the question was: Should they he sent simply for information, or should the Council consider them with a view tu replying to the German Government ? He proposed to take the papers to Paris and talk to M. Bourgeois and M. Quinones de Leon about the point.
Commendator AN3IL0TTI said as regards the Assembly only Siam had sent in the names of its Delegates officially. Others were known unofficially, for enarapete : M. ITenizelos, M. Paderewski and Mr. Rowell (Canada). He understood, unofficially, that the Italian Delegation would consist of Signor TIT TON I, Signor de Nicola, and Signor Bonomi. He supposed that these three had been chosen as representing respectively the Liberal, the Popular and the Socialist parties.
He further referred to the importance of learning the names of the Delegates as soon as possible and. to a sugge stio n which had been made that Members of the Secretariat might possibly take steps privately to impress this point on their respective Governments. It was pointed out that it would be difficult to get replies in the cases of countries such as Spain, Norway and Sweden where the Government might easily be changed between now and Nov ember.
Mr. COLEAN suggested that a circular letter could be sent to the Embassies and Legations in London, saying that the Secretariat had formed a Committee to consider the practical arrangements for the Assembly and it would facilitate its work if the names could be communicated even privately to the Secretary-General at an early date. ji discussion followed as to the desirability of this Committee meeting forthwith, but it was agreed that as the
majority of the '.■¡embers were away it had better wait, and that if the Members worked out their ideas beforehand it would be sufficient for the Committee to meet after, or at any rate, just before ihe Baris meeting Of the Counoil. The proposed letter to diplOBaatio representatives couDj. also be held up for the present.
Mr* CO I BAB suggested the desirability of having a regular arrangement by which, with the concurrence of the financial Director, members of the Staff oould travel to and from Paris by air, He did not think that considering that two days were saved on the double journey, the difference in price was very great; thus in his own case two days' allowance, plus the cost of the terrestrial journey amounted to £13 - ’while the return ticket by air cost, he believed, only 18 guineas.
Mr. lid IB thought the Belying Co. would probably make special arrangements for the League if requested to do so, and it was generally agreed that two days of Mr. Colban's time were far more valuable than c ould be computed in cash.
Commendator aNCILOTTI said that the terms of purchase for the Hotel National at GENliVA had been agreed upon. Sir Herbert AMS3, Mr * HUSTON and Dr. HUDSON had gone to GBBUVa to make the definite contract.
M. HAS'COUM said he had two points to refer to: l) a question raised by M. Aghnides whether the Assembly ought not to be asked to consider the question of financing and protecting Armenia, in accordance with the Council's decision of April last. His own view was that, seeing that the subsequent negotiations had so far had no result, and that President GILSON had not replied to the Supreme Council's communication to him, the Assembly could hardly deal with the question.
The latter had spoken of further
consultâtion with the Council, so the Council might perhaps say that it would he glad to learn from the Supreme Council what president Wilson's decision was and whether the further consultation referred to should not tale place as soon as it was known. Unless such steps were taken he feared that public opinion would say that the league was doing nothing in this important matter, perhaps even the Assembly might take it up and address the Supreme Council about it, thus creating a very difficult situation.
He suggested the possibility of privately consulting the Members of the Council at Laris on the point.
2) There was the question of the admission of Germany to the league: He felt sure the question would come up, but no one knew in what form it would do jo. Possibly Germany would raise it, possibly again some Power which had been neutral in the V/ar might do so. His own view was that there would be the requisite majority for her admission, but there	might well be strong resistance,
end we had to consider how this could be prevented from having very serious results. Public opinion unless set in the right path beforehand, might even force a Government against its will to resist the proposal. The question was a very grave one. It was clear that the secretariat as such could not intervene, but it could perhaps do something to influence public opinion before the event. He under stood that there would probably not be objection on the part of Belgium, but in some other countries, particularly franco, there were many factors working for resistance and a crisis might possibly rise which would bo dangerous both for franco and for the League. He was taking it that Germany would carry out the agreement made at dl'A; if not, the situation would of course be different. Ho was writing a memorandum on the question.
Mr.IJAIH referred to a request received from the "frankfurter Beitung" to be sugnlied with the pamrhlets prepared for
t-he-f 'Inancia].- jonferenoe. and asked the opinion of the meeting as to the action to he taken on this request.
Mr.COLBiST said that as the pamphlets could he openly purchased, he thought we should despatch them without necessarily writing anything about it. Germany was trying,as her action about the registration of Treaties and her numerous letters about Supen and Malmedy proved, to show that she recognised the League as a factor of International affairs, and he thought we ought not to snub her. Some months ago they did not even acknowledge the receipt of our letters, and now they show quite a different spirit. This view was agreed to and the matter decided accordingly.

Mr. Layton,

Mr. 'Walters - SECRETAEY
said
Commendatore Anzilotti/that the question of chief importance at the moment was that of the Polish-Lithuanian dispute. He read out the telegram from the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Secretary-General<,	Immediately on
receipt of this telegram, we had sent it by telegraph to all the Members of the Council and he and M. Mantoux had had an interview on the afternoon of September 7th with the Polish Charge d1Affaires in London. The latter said that pourparlers had been begun betwoen the two Governments and that it was hoped that they would reach a
I peaceful result in a few days. He therefore asked tha^ the telegram should be considered for the present as simply having been sent for information. M. Quinones de Leon had been informed by telegraph of this conversation. A message had this morning been received from him to the effect that he oaa H. Bourgeois Loth thought that the question should be at once placed on the agenda for the Paris meeting and the Lithuanian Government informed. He was not certain whether this message was sent before Senor Quinones de Leon had received our telegram or not.
Meanwhile a letter had been received from the lithua-
nian Charge ¿’Affaires forwarding the copy of a note addressed 1037- his Government to the Polish Government dated Sept, 6th. This document was then read out.
- 2 -
Sir Herbert Ames pointed ont that when Prince Sapieha’a telegram was sent, the Polish Government had not received
the telegram from the Governmentjof Lithuania,
'Sr
Mo Mantous: said the question now at issue was rot that of the substance of the dispute, hut of the position of the league in relation to it, The polish telegram is in fact an appeal to the League; the Lithuanian letter is not an appeal, hut it gives the League a certain standing in any dealings it may wish to have with the Lithuanian Government in the -case* If in sc o or dance with ¡Be nor Quinones de Xeo^s views, the Polish telegram was communicated to the Lithuanians, the Lithuanian note must also /
he given to the Poles*
Meanwhile the r*'I‘imes,f published a statement by Reuter which in substance was inspired by the Poles and really states their present case, vis; that they hoped to solvt the question peaceably, but if this failed they would desire the intervention of the Leagues In any case, ho considered that we ought to study the question seriously
V
at onoe, in case it was. to come up on September 16th.
Lr„ Hudson pointed out that under Art,17, Lithuania should be invited tc become a temporary Member of the League, under conditions to be laid down by the Council, ie wondered whether the latter should not meet before the 16th for the more or less formal purpose of inviting Lithuania to comply with the conditions of artiole 17,
Me Mantous said there was no hope of having a meeting earlier than the 16th, and that if the Council followed a prooedure analogous to that adopted in the Asland Islands oase: of inviting Lithuania, though not a Member of the League, to send a representative to the
Counoil/
s
Cctmoil meeting; this would be an oven quicker way of dealing with the case.
DTo Hudson thought that it would bo difficult to treat Lithuania in just the same way as Finland, since her Government was unrecognised anti her position very unstable* Comnendatore Anzilottl said that the Lithuanian Government oould be told that the matter would come up on the 16th, and that they ought to have a man ready in case the Council wished to hear him*
It was generally agreed that the Polish charge d^ffaires, whom Mantoux was to see at 4«SO, should be told that the question must come before the Council unless an official request to the contrary was made in writing on behalf of the Polish Government.
Mo Mantoux said that he was also hoping to see Mro Fisher that afternoon. He was already desirous of seeirg him in order to obtain his views privately on the Armenian question which he had mentioned at the previous meeting; and now that he was to be the British representative at the Council, it would he specially useful to have a talk with him«, Speaking generally he thought that the matt,nr was preeminently one for the action of the league« The two parties, eaoh based their case on ¿tn international agreement; the Poles on a decision of the Supreme Council; the Lithuanians on a Treaty with Russia0 The only bridge between these two Acts was the mediation of the league«
Commendatore Anzilotti said that the letter from the Lithuanian Charge d’Affaires showed a disposition to submit the matter to the League, or at any rate ought to be treated as doing so.
Sir Herbert Ames referred to a question which was originally on the agenda for the Paris meeting: the method of payment of the Staff of the Secretariat after the move to Geneva. Yaninas possible alternatives were mentioned. Sir Herbert ..toes said that the Secretary-General wanted the Members of the Secretariat to have an opportunity of expressing their views before the matter was submitted to the Council. He had in preparation a note on the subject which he hoped to circulate this week. It was no® not possible for the subject to be dealt with in Paris.
Qommendatore Anziletti mentioned that Signor Pittoni had written to say ho wished his resolution on monopolies etc. to be dealt with at the Brussels and not at the Paris meeting. Signor Ferraris would represent Italy at the Paris meettog.
Dr. Hudson mentioned that a letter had been received from the British Government to the effect that they had made certain suggestions to tho Governments of other members ox the League through the intermediary of their diplomatic agents abroad as to the practical methods to be followed in carrying out Acit. IQ cf the Covenant. The suggestions made dealt with points not mentioned in the Secretariat’s memorandum on +>,c3 subject, nevertheless, he thought it a most suprising procedure, seeing that the British Government had been represented at the Council meeting which accepted the memorandum. Fe suggested that the attention of the British representative on tho Council should be drawn to this action on the part of his Government.
Sir Herbert toes said the Geneva contracts were now being roneoel for circulation to the Council. Two resolutions will be necessary: l) that 2 or 3 persons be named to go to Geneva at once to sign the contracts in the name of the League; £) approving the two options which had been obtained on turo adjacent properties. 'These options it was absolutely necessary
-5-
to have though it might not he necessary to use then.
ilr. Layton said that during the last week there had beon discussions between the French and British Governments regarding tho fact that as at present arranged the Geneva meeting and the Brus sols Conference would clash. It was now he believed definitely settled that the league should not be a3ked to postpone the Brussels meeting by either of these Governments. It followed that the Goneva meeting would be postponed since the experts who would attend there wore also delegates to Brussels. He understood that the French hoped that tho Brussels meeting would create an improved atmosphere for the Geneva one.
The German Delegation had now been nominated and was most satisfactory. It consisted of Herr Bergmann (the chief German representative for dealing with the Reparations Commise..on and a man who had made a very good impression in Paris) and of the Yice-President of tho Hc-fehs tag and the head of the Disccnto Gesellsehaft. This formed an expert financial and non-political delegation.
The French Delegation had also been named, consisting of M. Lefèvre, Head of the Credit lyonnais, M. de Fleuriau, of the French Ebbassy in London, and M. Avenolc Delegates had now beon appointed by Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. In fact all those invited had named their delegates, except Chili which, had refused, Austria and Hungary whose nomination was expected shortly, and the United States which Lad agreed to send a delegation nominated by the Government, but had not yet sent any names. Telegrams had been sent both privately and through the U.S. Embassy asking when the names might be expected.
Oommendatoro Anzilotti referred to thfc distinction between consultative and ordinary delegations, which seemed an obscure one, seeing that no delegation could do more that join in mailing recommendations.
Mr c LAYTOII said that it had originally been intended to have only Members of the league plus the United States as full members of the Conference. Other oountries might be asked to send delegates who oould express their views if invited to do so by the Conference, but would not have the right of taking part in its debates, How, he agreed, this distinction had practically ¿leappeered„ There remained only five States whose delegations were still in an inferior position, namely: Finland, Luxemburg, Esthonia, Lithuania and Latvia. He recommended that of these, Finland and Luxemburg should he asked to he full Members.
The publications of the Secretariat on matters to he discussed at the Conference had only been issued in French the previous week, so publicity in France had not yet been so good as in this country» Ee believed however that M. Comert was taking up this point.
He intended to transfer all Conference papers to a special Conference registry, and did not propose to send any documents back to London, Tho Daily Report would be sent hack in sufficient numbers for circulation to sections and they would he kspt informed through it.
Sir Herbert Ames said the sub-soramission on re-adjustment of contributions to the League would hold its first meeting on the 18th September in Paris; it included both financial and political experts, and it was suggested that he should attend as a witness and not as a Member. This he preV sumed would he a precedent which would often he followed in future cases. It of course meant that the Secretariat would have no responsibility for the report of the Commission concerned.
Mr» Mair said the special number of the Official Journal containing the scheme of the Permanent Court tfas now in proof and would he ready at the end of the week.
~ 7 -
Further, the complete text of the first number of the Treaty Series had now gone to the printers who hoped to send the pruof in a fortnight*
Telephone arrangements at Genera»- It seemed likely that the authorities would give us each day half an hour at mid-day and half an hour in the evening of direct service from Geneva to London* He thought that if certain tests at which he would be present were satisfactory, we could accept this plan, though of course on the understanding that we should only pay for time actually taken»
Dr» Hudson, said he was going to the U.S.A. on Saturday, and would be glad to have any suggestions as to what we could do there. He thought there was a danger that the IT.S. might come into the League and not come in no the Labour Office, which he thought would he very dangerous. Still he would prefer this, rather than she should join neither organisation »
At this point Me Mantoux returned after seeing the Polish Chargé dTAffaires» .The latter was unable to make an offioial statement on the authority ef his Government to the effect that the intervention of the League was not desired and it was therefore decided: l) to telegraph to Senor Quinones de Leon that his suggestions were being carried out at once;
2) to telegraph to the members of the Council that the Polish-Lithuanian dispite would be placed on the agenda for September 16th;	3) to warn the Polish and Lithuanian Governments of this
in case the Council should desire to hear their representatives, and to communicate to each the statements sent in by the other.
Further it was agreed that it was unnecessary to ask the Secretary-General to out short his holiday or to ask M. Monnet to come over from Pari*.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OP LEAGUE OP NATIONS1 UNIONS AT MILAN.
A discussion took place as to whether the Secretariat should be represented at this meeting. Sir Herbert Ames thought it
1 advisable to send am influential member of the Secretariat, to give an account of what the Council had done. The Secretary-General considered that this was inadvisable since he did not wish the disoussion of this subject at the Assembly to be prejudiced in any way by a statement from the Secretariat, It was finally agreed to adopt Dr. van Hame 11 s suggestion that a member of the Information Section should be sent, to gauge the general feeling of the meeting on League questions. He was not to act as representing the League, since the object of his presence was to obtain information not to impart it.
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE.
The Secretary-General said that he had read the reports of the 2 meetings held in Paris, and considered that frequent meetings of this Committee would ne necessary as soon as a sufficient number of Directors returned.
It was agreed that the list of Committees and Sections responsible for the Secretaries of these Committees should be circulated to the Directors of Sections, in order that they might submit to the Secretary-General the names of members of their
Sect ions

- 2 -
Sections whom they propose as Secr-ebcuries for these Committees. He considered that as, according to present intentions, a short, •uncoloured summary of each question would he made hy a member of the General Committee before the subject was referred to a special Committee, the Secretary of each special Committee should prepare in good time such a statement.
TRANSLATIONS AT -THE ASSEMBLY •
It was decided that, though each Committee should be an independent running concern, translations should all bo done in the Pool. Stenographers would/only supplied to such Committees as desire* to have procès verbal of their proceedings.
ACCOMMODATION FOR REPRESENTATIVES .
It was agreed that Mr. Huston should write a letter, asking if the national Delegations for the Assembly required accommodation at Geneva, and, if so, that they should be asked to write to M«. Patio who would pass on the request to M. Trachsal who had been appointed by the Genevese authorities to act on their behalf.
GENERAL COMMITTEE OP TILE ASSEMBLY.
A discussion took place on the organisation of the General Committee of the Assembly.
Dr. van Hamel agreed with the Secretary-General that the General Committee should consist of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Secretary-General, as suggested in the Draft Rules of Procedure, and that, if necessary, additional members should be co-opted by the Committee.
The Secretary-General thought that in special cases Council Representatives would probably be appointed Rapporteurs on Assembly Committees for special subjects.
Sir Herbert Ames considered that a Committee of Chairmen would be necessary, in order to ensure uniformity of work. The Secretary-General said he was in favour of giving the Committees a fairly free hand.
LANGUAGES.

The Secretary-General agreed to speak to Sir Maurice Hankey atout it.
flO?MJNI£AT IONS AT GERE?A .
Commendatore Anzilotti asked how liaison would be kept between the various Governments and the League, when established at Geneva»
Would the Diplomatic Representatives at Berne act as more or less permanent Members of the Council, for ordinary questions, replaced, when very important matters were raised, by the regular Representatives? Or would the regular Representatives appoint juniors to remain at Geneva to sit on the Council during ordinary business? The
danger of the latter would be that the regular Representatives might leave the work more and more to their juniors.
It was hoped that if the diplomatic representatives at Berne did much of the work on the Council, Governments would in time appoint really eminent men in Switzerland»
The Secretary-General expressed the opinion that perhaps
the best plan would be for there to be 3 national Representative s fa) The regular Representative on the Council in his I own country;
(b)	That country's Diplomatic Representative at Berne;
(c)	A junior Representative permanently at Geneva, with a small office.
so that the Council meetings would be attended, according to the importance of the questions discussed, by (a), fb) or fc).
Major Abraham raised the question of communications with the Ikess in other countries from Geneva. The Secrutary-General
thought that the Press would send first class representatives to Geneva, and that the best plan would be to work through them,
Father than by sending representatives of the Information Section
Pans, London etc.,	APPLICATION OF BULGARIA/

Major Abraham reported that Bulgaria had applied, thro-ugh the British Foreign Office, for admission to the league.
It was agreed that no action should he taken until she applied
officially direct to the League.
SEAT OF COMMISSIONS.
Sir Herbert Ames asked whether all OommmnSions, especially
the Military, Naval and Air Commission would be established at
Geneva. He said that the obvious advantages of centralisation had
undoubtedly induced the Council to agree to the purchase of the site at Geneva. Would it be possible on those grounds to alter
the decision to hold the Transit Conference at Barcelona?
The Secretary-General thought it was impossible to change
this decision, but that in future, all Commissions and Conferences
I
should sit at Geneva. He felt sur s that the Council would insist ; on the establishment of the Military Naval and Air Commission at Geneva.

The Secretary-General, Commendstore Ansilotti, Sir Herbert Amos,
Mr. Colban,
Dr. Van Hamel,
M. Mantoux,
Dame Rachel Crowdy,
Mr. Abrahams.
■ Mr. Walters - SECRETARY.
The Secretary-General said that it had not been possible during the last week to make much progress regarding the actual arrangements for the Assembly. The experience gained at the Brussels Conference should be of great assistance on the material side. Ho had received a letter to-day from Mr, Layton, who was very well satisfied with the general progress. The first feeling of the Delegates had boon that they could not hope for much result: 1~ ) because the rtnnrations question was barred; 2°) because the Conference could only make recommendations, and could not bind their Governments. That opinion had changed. They had found that there was a largo field in which useful work could be done. The reparations question was not the only one that mattered and pressure of public opinion would give value to the work of the Conference, so that it would prove to have been worth while, even if no concrete results could bo shown.
The mere fact that German and other ex-enemy delegations had been present and that no incident had occured was in itself of groat importance and had ho believed, had good effect, particularly on French opinion.
The financial situation of the Secretariat had net improved in the last week, but he hoped for the British contribution to-morrow or this week at the latest.
í
-s-
Sir Herbert Ames said he was going to ask Members of the Secretariat to write privately to their Government about it. He would ;send round a copy of a letter he had written to M. Bourgeois, of which they could make any use they pleased.
The Secretary-Goneral remarked that the claim was for a period, half of which had already elapsed, so that we were entitled to press for payment.
As regards the Assembly he felt more sure than ever that the scheme of Committees to be appointed after a short opening statement in full meeting was the right one. We had to do two things; 1°), get the work done, 2o ) interest the Press and public opinion* Prom this point of view, he thought Dr. Van Hamel's suggestion that the general report on the work of the Council should he dealt with at 2 or 3 public meetings early in the proceedings was an admirable cno. There remained the question of the "steering” Committee. This, he thought, could not bo decided till neafor the time. He thought it should be discussed at a full meeting of Direotors at Geneva which might take place on We dne s day Ho ve mb or 3rd.
He had two further points to raise;
1) Regarding documents for circulation hy the Secretariat which reached us in languages other than English or French, and suggested that a circular should be sent to all Members of the League, saying that unless a French or English translation of any document were included, the Secretariat would only be responsible for circulating it as received, and that only if enough copies were sent.
Mr. Colhan thought that such a circular was unnecessary as far as his experience went; the Governments always sent a French or English translation. Documents only in German had been received
from
from certain private persons or Associations, but in such a caoe it was open to the Secretariat to tell the senders that they must forward a French or English version. It was agreed not to send the proposed circular.
2.) Documents circulated to Members of the Council for information ( excluding documents prepared by the Secretariat do not at present go to other Members of the League, till after the next meeting of the Council following their «irculation to the Council.
The Secretary-General said that he was doubtful whether this was a good plan, or whether it would not be better to send suoh documents to all Members of the League simultaneously. The matter had a special bearing on minority petitions and the like; obviously the country affected ought to know of any such petition. The Treaties however were very strict, and it was doubtful whether a copy could go to the interested country unless it went to all countries. But such documents lost their chief effectiveness unless'they were known to the interested country and unless that country knew that they had been circulated to the other Members. From the point of view of machinery, it would be easier to circulate simultaneously to all.
Commendatore ANZILOTTI mentioned the case of documents communicated for the confidential information of the Council#
An instance had occurred during the polish-lithuanian dispute.
It was agreed that in such cases, each one as it arose should be dealt with on its merits.
Mr. Co Han thought that all such documents ought to be circulated. They could if necessary be made confidential, but it was necessary to show that the Secretariat worked in the open, and did not conceal anything from the Members of the League.
4
Dr. Van Hamel and M. Mantoux thought the proposed plan had certain dangers. A Government or a Delegate of a Government might 'desire to put something tentatively before the Council which he would not be willing to risk having sent to all the Members. We should avoid anything which could discourage parties to a dispute from giving, for instance confidential information about the attitude of their Government in certain eventualities or running the risk of driving them to confide in the representative of a particular State, rather then in the Council as a whole.
The Seeretary-General suggested that the objection raised would be met by laying it down that each Director when deciding on the circulation of a paper, should also decide this point, adopting as a general rule that unless there were special reasons to the contrary, circulation should be made to all the Members of the League.
( NOTE J?y_SE0rJ5TAi?Yr~ The disposal sheet to be used with all documents intended for circulation provides a convenient way of recording this decision.)
Commendatore Anallotti mentioned that he was going to Paris in a day ot two in order to see Monsieur Bourgeois about the Permanent Court of International Justice.
Dr. Van Hamel said he had just had a telegram that the Dutch Government would make a contribution to the typhus campaign in proportion to that of the British Government. He asked whether contributing Governments would be the lojers if ether Governments who had been appealed to had not acceeded to the appeal.
Dame Rachel Crowdy explained that contributions were not at present being touched. Current expenses were met from the Leaguo Budget. The contributions finally asked for would be in proportion to the total sum contributed.
5
Dr. Van Hamel pointed out that an important difference between the material conditions at Brussels and at Geneva was the fact that the former Conference was being held in a parliamentary building with lobbies, smoking-rooms and conveniences of every kind. He also asked who was responsible for arrangements of the Staff, of porters, etc..
It was pointed out that the former point had been partly met by knocking holes in the Hotel Victoria. As regards the latter, Mr. Huston was in charge and it would be easy to find a number of previous hotel porters etc. who would be suitable for the work.
Dr. Van Hame1 thought that they should be appointed at least a week before the meeting.
Sir Herbert Ames said he was circulating a memorandum emphasising the need for internal economy in the Secretariat.
Mr. Col ban said that he had some points to discuss regarding the Assembly, iff. Patio asked for a definite ruling as to who would decide the seating in the Hall and the allocation of rooms in the Pic-Pic Building for Committees and Delegations.
It was decided that Mr. Colban should prepare a plan with the agreement of Dr. Van Hamel, M. Mantoux and Sir Herbert Ames, and that Mr. Huston would have authority to put the agreed plan into effect.
It was further agreed that the seating arrangements on the floor of the Hall should be in French alphabetical order; the British Dominions coming under their own capital letter. It was also agreed that it should be left to the option of the speakers whether they would speak from their place or go to a rostrum. The reports of Committees etc ........
would of course "be read from the rostrum, and any member desiring to make a weighty speech would naturally go up to it, but in an ordinary disous3ion Members would probably prefer 't;0 sneak from their -place. The President could of course always ask a Member to come to the rostrum,
M. Colban said as regards the Pic-Pic Building there were certain difficulties. The ground floor 'would be reserved for postal arrangements etc., The first floor mainly used for Committees. It contained 14 rooms, some large, some small. On the Snd, 3rd, and 4th floors, there were only 35 rooms. So as we must reckon on ab&ut 40 dole gations we should be short, and consequently the Committees oould not have all 14 rooms pn the 1st Ploor. Thus other Committee rooms must be found, and he proposed that this should be done at the Hotel National. Suoh an arrangement would not be practioally inconvenient, as all had motor-cars, and it was only a ten minutes’ walk, and it would have the advantage of familiarising representatives of distant lands with the Offices of the Secretariat, It was agreed that all Delegations should be accomodated in the Pic-Pic Building, and all Committees either there or in the Hotel National.
Mr. Colban 'would draw up a plan in agreement with Dr.Van Hamel, M.Mantoux and Sir Herbert Ames, and that Mr. Huston should be authorised to carry out .the agreed plan.
Mr. Colban had proposed that '’Nations Geneven should be the telegraphic address of the Secretariat.
As regards printing arrangements, M. Patio had suggested that a local man who knew all the conditions should bo responsible for getting the printing done by local firms. It was agreed that Mr-. Huston should have authority to make arrangements
with him.
- 7 -
M. Hatio declared that whatever happened everything would he ready by hovemb^u 15th.
M, Oolban said that with regard to the report on the work of the Council which has to he submitted to the Assembly he thought there should be attached to each section of the report an index and documents circulated to the Council on that subject.
The S.G. said that, if it was agreed that the Council would not have objections to make, he agreed to the proposal, but the Report should not be held up while an index was being prepared.
Sir Herbert Ames suggested that in order to avoid the large demands for copies of the documents which would certainly be made, they should all be collected in a certain room at the Hotel Rational and the delegations should be informed that they/could be consulted there at any time, but could not be removed.
At this point the S.G. was compelled to leave the room temporarily to see Senor Quinones de Leon.
Commendatore Anzilotti took the chair.
M. Mantoux said that he bad some small points to raise regarding Geneva. lo) There should be a speuial organisation to deal with the personnel. The financial Director would have no time to do this, nor would the establishment Officer. 2o) The coal question. - M. Haas who had been negotiating on this matter seemed doubtful of success, Meanwhile Mr. Butler had circulated to the International Labour
Office personnel a notice ------ to supply them with coal
at 130 or 160 swiss francs per ton, according to quality Tjiis was about half the current price, and he thought that the Members of the Secretariat ought to have the same privilege. 3o) Removals. - Sir Herbert Ames said Huston had
i ■,
drgiwn up a statement on this point which will be circulated.
X
/
8.
4)	Customs. He will see Mr.Huston about this.
5)	Office furniture. Sir Herbert iUn.es said that an;; furniture in use in London which was necessary for the working arrangements of a section could be taken to Geneva. Mr.Huston was asking for estimates of space required for nepers etc.
The Secretary-General then returned.
•
M.Mantour said that the situation regarding the Aaland Islands commission was as follows:
3aron Bsyens has accepted, M.Calonder has not replied;
H.ferraris seemed inclined to accept. There was the further ¡uestion of an ATrerican Member. The American ambassador in Paris was much interested and a door could be left open for a 4th Member to join the commission. The Ambassador hdd telegraphed to /asnington M.Bourgeois was quite in agreement with the proposal. If an upnointment were made at once in America the Member could bo here in . about three weeks.
An important point was that of the date at which the report could be presented and the Council's decision made. It was impossible for thi^to be at Brussels.	There-after the .assembly
would be in session and the Council could hardly meet for such an important question during the Aserbly. He suggested, that there Hiorld be a Council Meetina for the piTrpose at the end of the j Assembly Meeting, i.e. abort 10th December. The Becretary-Goneral thought it would be rather a good thing to have it during the Assembly in case one party appealed to the Assembly. M.Mantoux r) agreed with this. He thought that the Members might be privately told to let the Council have their report in time.
He suggested that the Finnish declare,tion which seemed to say that they would refuse to accept certain conclusions should, if maintained, be circulated to the Members
-9-
of tho League in connection with Finland’s request fc r admission*
The S.Gr. said it had been already circulated, together with tho reply he had sent,
M. Mantorne rend a note regarding the payment of expenses of the Aaland Commission for submission tc the Council at Brussels.
Dr. Van Hamel said that a rather important question was involved, as if it were decided that the interested States should
*
pay, it might lead to poorer countries being afraid tc appeal to tho League on account of tho expenses it might involve.
Tho S.G. said that he would prefer to see discussed only the specific question cf this commission and if possible to avoid general principles. It would bo necessary to warn the Finnish and Swedish representatives who would have to be present at tho discussion.
Mo Colban argued against submitting tho matter to the Council at all. The Council would appear to be bringing up a point which it had forgotten in Paris. Further this was a case of peace or war and it was undesirable to have a discussion about a paltry ££.000 or £3000.- It was a detail to bo settled between the Delegates of tho two Governments concerned and the Seeretary-Guneral or the financial Director. This point of view was generally agreed to. The Council could of course discuss the question if it wished, but wo should not warn the Finnish or Swedish representativos, M, Ms n t o ux re ad. a note regarding the interpretation c-f the phrase : ,Tterritoires occupés par la Lithuania a l'est de la linge de demarcation du 8 decembre." The difference botwoen tho Polish and the Lithuanian interpretation cf this phrase was
a serious crux.
i
-10-
There were two questions on the list of subjects to bo
dealt with by Committees of the Assembly which specially affected
his section, viz, that of the Admiscion of Slates and that of the
four
method of selection and appointment of the/non-permanent members of the Councilc As regards othav questions ho might wish to arrange that the work of the Committees dealing with them .should be followed by a Member of his section., not necessarily as Secretary of the Committee,
Any List of Secretaries circulated to the Members of the Assembly should in his view simply give the names cf the Secretaries and not refer to their Sections. He agreed that it would be very difficult to find the right man to act as Secretary of the Committee on admission of States because we must not have anyone who oould be supposed to be interested in the results.
Probably the Committee would split up into 3 or 4 Committees each with their separate secretaries.
As regards the 4 non-permanent members of the Council, the Secretary-General said he was net sure that the Scandinavian suggestions wore sound. He thought it ¡important that the Secretariat should give consideration to the subject and decide what method it, for __-ia part, considered the best.
Monsieur Mantoux said that he was returning to Paris the next night, and would come bach to London as soon as the Alland Commission had separated. The Polish Lithuanian situation did not necessitate his being in Paris because the commission had been instructed to report simultaneously to the Scoretary-General and to M. Bourgeois. Ho would draw up a report to be bead to the Council on the action taken on these two matters.

PRESENT:
The Secretary-General Oorannndatore Anzilotti, Sir Herbert Ames,
Mc Attclioô Mr. Oclbah, Mo Oomert,
Dr. Van Hamel,
M0 Man to tux j Mc Rappard,
Dam© Rachel Orowdy,
Mr. Walters - SECRETARY
The Seoretary“GoneraI said that speaking generally he thought the work done by the Council at Brussels had been very satis factory., M„ Man toux had just informed him that the Ameriean Member of the Aaland Islands Ocmmission had boen appointed and would sail direct to Stockholm tc join the other members there. He was a Mr. Elkiss, now judge, formally Ambassador at Cons tantinopiec Signor Ferraris had definitely resigned«
The Polish Government had unoffieially stated they aaoopted the Councilrs propositions, Lithuania had stated that she agreed in principle, hut made certain reserves.
Eeonomlo and Financial organisation,“ Letters had alroady gone to the 10 Members of the Committee appointed to oarry on the work of the financial sub-committee at Brussols. For the eoonomic part of the work, the names were to bo ready for the Council meeting which was to take place before the Assembly.
As regards that Council meeting, he asked whether thei'e was likely to be any objection to its boing on Sunday the 14th,
M, Rappard said that there would certainly bo none, at any rate, if the hours of special church services woro avoided.
The Socretary-Genefal said at the worst it might be hold
on Monday aft ornoon. It would bo best if tho Council could meet
on the repelling of Saturday 13th,, hut it was a question whether M, Bourgeois would ha able to oomo. He thought he wot or that wo should try to have tho mooting then,
Mr, Oolhan said this would ho all right so far as the preparation of tho work was oonoemod, M, Ishirs roport would bo oiroulatod hoforo the meeting, Tho Sooretary^Goneral mentioned that the British Government was vary anxious to have the Danzig matter regulated as soon as possible,
There was cno further point tc whioh his attention had boon dfrawn by Conmcndatoro Anzilctti. This had reforonoc to tho oards of permis do Bojour from tho Geneva polioo. Ocmmendatorc Anzilotti feared that by aooepting those wo might be derogating from the prinoipio of artiolo 7, another possible point of view was that they constituted a kind of rooord of the persons entitled to tho privileges of article 7, Iho Labour Office had signed them and ho thought they might be useful tc the Secretariat, II, Rappayd said that ho understood the Swiss Govorn-aent had wishod to roach, a cloar agroemont with the Soorotariat as tc privileges involved under artiolo 7« Tho Secrotary-Goneral said that Dr. Tan Hamol was appointing a Member of his soction tc deal specially with this subjoot. In the moamtimo, ho asked Dr. Tan Hamol to draft a letter to tho Genevese authorities expressing our point of view regarding the permis do flejour.
Assembly mooting,“ The Socrotaiy-Gonoral invited oomments on the memorandum whioh he had oiroulated on tho work of the Assembly. Kio contents of this memorandum were- mainly duo tc the suggestions cf nsiour Monnot, Prom the first tho main difficulty had boon the domination of Ghonittoes. TOiat was wanted was that eaoh Delogation Ihould fcol that it had the right to bo represented on every Oommittuc, Ind tho proposals in the memorandum were intended to guarantee .tM-b.
If a Delegation consisted of only one Member, he would put down his namo
-3“
for every Oonnittoo and would have the right to -attend any meeting of. a Committee.
As regards substitutes, ho felt strongly that while delegates night sand someone to lis&toa to the discussion of a Ocmnittec, such persons could not join .in tho discussion , still loss in tho vote«,
M. Hunt )usr remarked that the views cf L21, Bourgeois and Borthelot were substantially the st.,..c,
Dr. Tun Eared» thought that while such a ruling was desirable in theory, it might prove difficult in practice, where you had'important non as substitute delegates, such as IT* lunge.,,
On tho guest ion of credentials of substitute delegates Dr. Tan Hanoi pointed out that this was provided i\-r in the rules of procedure* They should bo accredited either by tho principal I ole gat o on the instructions ox his Government or by the three delegates noting together. Mr. Gclban suggested an addition to pago £ cf tho nonorandurn covering this point.
Trio Socretary-Gonoral enumerated the Iicc.bers of tho Secretariat whom ho wished to act as general oooretaries of tho. six Committees, Euoh general secretary would be assisted by representatives of tho sections concerned in the various subjects dealt with by his Committee. Ho should also appoint one member of his staff to keep $n touch with tho general internal organisation for the Assembly and to deal with Hr. Dixon, with the.Editor cf tho Officio-1 Journal, with the Distribution Branch etc.
A discussion followed on tho treatment of tho Spanish language at the Assembly, The Secretary-General said ho had heard on good authority that Spain and all South American States would ur’30, a:, xhey had successfully done at Washingtonthat Spanish that Spanish should be regarded as a third official language,
on an equal footing with English and French. He thought that they would be content if we were able to promise to print the
official journal.
4
in three languages and otherwise to help them in every way we oQuid,
HM. Attollco and Rappar d, and others, thought that this would involve an impossible amount of work, and that it would be sufficient to promise tc print in full any speeches made in Spanish giving a summary of the other speeches made. This -would meet the real feelings of the Spanish speaking delegates whose principal ' desire was to send home something to show the part they had played in the debates. The Secretary-General said that he quite agreed in principle with this, but we must make sure that it would satisfy them, otherwise they might choose to force a decision as to Spanish being an official language, and if so they would probably carry their point and we should be worse off than before.
There followed a long discussion on the question whether it would be bettor to have a separate Committee on the credentials of the Delegates. There might be one or two difficult points for suoh a Committee to settle, e.g. as, to tho position in the Assembly of ths Delegates of Hedjaz and Venezuela. On the other hand, it was desirable to have at least a majority of members whose title could not be in doubt when the President was elected.
It was decided that the most practical plan was to make an alteration in the proposed agenda and in the proposed times for taking the first subjects on it, as follows:
1)	Report of Secretary-Gener al on credentials (1st day)
2)	Election of President (1st day)
3)	Temporary adoption of rules of procedure (1st day)
4)	Adoption of agenda ( 1st day)
5)	nomination of Committees (2nd. day, names to be
received on Wednesday morning)
Dr, Von Hamel urged that the programme of work at the beginning should be kept as elastic as possible and that when possible, tho mornings should be devoted to Committee work and the afternoons to public discussion. He was not sure whether the wording of the Secretary-General's memorandum was, intended to exclude this, but the discussion on the report of the Council might very well go
forward
•5-
Aer the Committees had got to work. l't was desirable that no
1-res si on should he given that an attempt had been nude to confine
»
jit discussion to a limited tins,. Ec further suggested that it would ie desirable to have a certain number of Vice-Presidents who could Mo the Chair from time to time*.
■Ike Secretary-General said that this seemed tc him to involve icjjious difficulties, he proposed as an alternative that tho Chairman if Committees might receive the title of Vice-President, and this was ;en-3rally agreed to. It was further agreed on Dr. Van Hamel1 s ¡aggestion that M„ Hymans should he asked to announce that It would not le necessary for Delegates to exchange visiting cards, as M. Clemonseau iad done at the beginning of the Paris Conference.
Ma Mautoux said ho had a certain number of questions which he idhed to have settled before M. Denis left for Paris that evening;
1} as regards the payment of expenses of troops sent to Lithuania« ine system could be that these expenses should he advanced from the funds (the league and deducted from the contributions payable by the countries osjeerned, whether those who sent the troops or those in whose interest iev were sent,, This was considered to involve serious disadvantages;, further plan would bo that the expenses should be met by the Powers ending troops, to be recovered eventually from the interested Powers; us suggestion was generally agreed to.
2J The question of outfit allowance for Officers sent on League Jezrrice to severe climates. The Spanish Officer sent to Lithuania had Iroady returned with congestion of the lungs, and the others were asking or an outfit allowance of £80.- before returning. This was the sum Panted to Officers appointed on similar service under the Treaty of lPe* It was agreed that seeing these Officers were being paid by their ■ernmonts and only receiving subsistence allowance from the League,
* ras reasonable to allow them a certain sum for outfit and the figure -:ig "estod was £50.
6
M. Mantcux said that it was important to establish the principle that where you had a Committee of the Council appointed for a special purpose as in the case of the Polish-Lithuanian dispute, all its detail work should he done through the agency of the secretariat. The Council Committee should deal only with points of principle.
Method of holding the "consultstion populaireU , ■. Bourgoois had asked Colonel Chardlgny to draft a plan to be considered by the Council. Colonel Chardigny's views were that the regular plebiscite method has been a failure. The elaborate precautions taken had had the exactly opposite effect frum that which they were intended to produce.	In the present case, it was not laid down
that there should be a formal plebiscite, and it was open to the League to hold a more rough and ready popular consultation.
Colonel Chardigny proposed a large Commission of 20 or 30 Officers who should gn round very quickly and summon the Inhabitants of each small district, to meet them in the villages, and take their votes on the spot; one Polish and one Lithuanian representative being present in each case when the votes were taken. M* Mantcux had pointed out that in towns of any size, and particularly in Vilna,. such procedure would be impossible and sone regular form of voting must be used.
The Secretary-General said that it would be a great mistake to try and draw up conditions in Paris. He hoped M. Bourgeois would instead propose to appoint, say; 3 commissioners who had had experience in such things, e.g. the Commission who had had charge of the plebiscite in Schleswig, and that they should go out and organise the worfc on the spot.
r
-7~
Dr. Van Hamel aaid that in a natter of 3uch vital inport an oe "both to the League and still more to the populations concerned, the Council must have tho final authority. He agreed that tho a oh one »ought to ho draftod on the spot by say three civil Commissioners, who aftor consulting the Govomnonta concerned should report to the Oounoil tho plan they proposed to adopt and receive the authorisation of tho Council before proceeding to carry it into offc6t. This view was generally agreed to, on condition that either the Oounoil should be willing to moet immediately for the purpose of giving every authority to the proposed scheme, or that M,
Bourgeois1 Committee should have authority to agreo to it in tho name of the Counoil, The nano of Mr, Von Sydow, the Swedish Commissioner in the Sohloswig plobicite vra3 mentionod as that of a partioularly suitable person for the Office of Commissioner,
Mr; Oclban said ho was anxious tc get tho seating arrangements kor tho Assomhly printed and circulated, and for this purpose it
Ieas necessary tc know tho position of Bquador, Honduras and licarugua. The question was whether they had deposited thoir ratification pf the Treaty of Versailles or not,
M. Mantoux undertook to find this out from the Foreign Office in Paris,
Mr. Golban said that M, Gignoux had asked tho Secretariat to leavo it to him to distribute tiokets for the Assembly, save those for the Delegations and Secretariat.
M, Rappard pointed out that in so far as the Assembly Iologatos v/oro the guests of tho Swiss Government it was with that Government and not with tho authorities of Geneva that v/o ought to deal. He suggested that wo slcould propose to tho Swiss Government to dispose of one tenth of tho tickets, keeping tho remainder in our own hands.
Sir Herbert Amos raised tho question of subsi3taneo allowance to Members of the Secretariat during the Assembly, and read a circular which ho proposed tc sond round on tho subject.
It was decided to send round this circular with certain
modifications

Minutes of a Directors Meeting held on Thursday, the ilth Nove mbe r»II0 HO as 3,3 O'. at Geneva.
Present: The Secretary General Monsieur Monnet 0ommondator g Ansilo 11i Pr.. Nitobo.

Mr* Walters (Seoretary.)
The Secretary Genaral said that the proposal of holding a lounoil Meeting on Saturday had fallen through. The following ?ero the subjeots On the Agenda for the Meeting:-
l) Names for the Sconomio Gimmittce, so far as they had been received;
S)	The Constitution Of Dan&ig;
3)	Polish Lithuanian question;
4)	Selection of Members of the Council tc
represent it during the disoussion of its Heport to the Assembly.
ho following would therefore have to be present; Monsieur Mantcux, fti Colban, Dr. Van Hamel, Mr. Layton. No Publio Meeting would be laid, and all Reports and Resolutions would be given as soon as Wssible to Monsieur Oomert, and handed out at onoe to the Press.
He hoped that all statements for the Chairmen of Committees >0hl& be ready by Saturday.
As regards the general plan for the Assembly, after discussing ^ with many people , he did not think that any more amendments were oculrad* Monsieur Attolioo had raised an important question. He bought it would be a mistake to allow discussion on tho statements mb.e by the Chairmen, for two reasons, 1) such discussions would be
/made
— S —
„j.do in ignoranoo of the real faots of the oaso, 2) the contributors to -Uicn! would be the critios and not the supporters of the plan proposed« s^e Committee would, therefore, get the impression that the Assembly as whole was oritioal of whatever was proposed. He thought that there «£8 a groat deal of truth in this, but the trouble was that if you had jo debate, then you had no publicity.
Monsieur Monnet said that many Cicmitteea would present a unanimous Report, and there would, therefore, be no effective debate at the end*
, if there were no debate on tho oooasion of the Chairmen’s statements, ■u lose publicity altogether, and publioity, he thought, was so important that for it we ought to risk the dangers pointed ou t by Monsieur flttolioo. Monsieur Attolioo said that ho thought tho pros and ocna rare somewhat nicely balanced» He did not, howevor, agree that there mild bo no debato on the prosontotion of Oooraittee Reports; that would be tho time for Delegations whoso Members had not been able to tarry a point in Committee to reiterate it in public« Monsieur Rap-pard HkObgrhf It would be bettor not to sit on tho safely Talvo, but to allow eroa thoso who wanted to oritloiso the opportunity of doing so« Shen their criticisms would be taken up in Committee, and If they wore ill-informed, their baselossness would be shown. Mr. Xioyton thought you mre much more likely to get an interesting debate before the Committee Report than after« Tou would then get opinions on the general aspects :f- the subject not oh particular details whloh might have formed sub-3*eota of debate in Committee. Pro Tan Hamel thought that after the Pesodtatlon of the Reports, there would genorally be little or no fcbate. Be feared, too, that even on the cooasion ef the Chairman’s i '«htoment, there would not be muoh.
Monslour Monnet and Moneleur Comort suggested that the Ohalrmon's itomcnte should bo oiroulatod 54 hours boforo thoy wero read out, eo it tho Delegations would havo time to think of some sensible remarks
tnako about thorn. Iho Secrotary-General pointed out that this
/involved
3
involved a difficulty in the matter of time. If the Chairmen were elected on Wednesday evening, it meant, therefore, that Thursday would "be a blaiik: day« Ur0 Go lb an thought that under the sin?: Committee scheme, it was urgently necessary to have early debates» He thought that many Delegations would come to theso well prepared to discuss general principles, The Secretary General said that he thought that the best plan would be to adopt Monsieur Oomert’s suggestion. The Chairmen elected on Wednesday evening would nominally spend [Thursday morning preparing their Deports, and these would be circulated midday on Thursday,, and the first of them oould be debated on Friday mcraing» It wa3 agreed that this did not involve any modifi-oetion in the nature of the statements; they should remain as at present quite objective? though it was expeotod that they would be followed by exposes made from the point of view of special countries, e.g. the expose which the Scandinavian Representatives would want to give regarding the amendments they proposed. A day would bo given for each discussion if possible.
The Secretary General said that ho wished Monsieur
Holin, to be responsible that the President Scold. be in a
position to announce each day what was proposed to bo done
and tho reason« for it, e. g» on Monday afternoon he must
explain why the Six Gomir.it to os system wr.s proposed»
¿a regards the Agenda, there would have to be two lists.
The existing list would be gohe through by the President,
item
who would ash at each	whether any objection were raised
to ito Separate items, would not be voted on unless sudh objection was raised^ and the Agenda would be adopted as a whole» Secondly there would be a supplementary 7»io%
] each
4
each item on which must he. separately voted on, i.o. the Peruvian and Bolivian requests and the requests for admission of Albania, Bulgaria and Austria.
A discussion followed as to whether the election of the president should precede the adoption of temporary Buies of Procedure or not. Monsieur Bolin urged that it was difficult to elect a President until you had agreed on Rules for governing methods of election. Dr.van Hamel agreed and thought that the provisional Prosi dent should ash for the temporary adoption of the Provisional Rules of Procedure without discussion, in view of the fact that the definit Rules would form a subject fer discussion a day or two later,
Cn the other hand, there was the danger that discussion on the adopt! of temporary Rules of Procedure might he prolonged. Mr.Golban considered that the Covenant provides the accessary ruling. It is a matter of procedure and can be decided by a majority vote and carried cut according to any special rule which may be agreed for the moment, It was decided to have only one candidate if possible', and in that case thoxo might conceivably be no necessity to take a vote.
Monsieur Rappard asked whether the Council would on Sunday deal with the question of the Constitution cf the Mandates Commission. He understood that this followed from the Proces uorbaux of the Brussels Meeting. The Secretery-gcncra1 said that it was true that Mr. Balfour agreement still had to be given tc the Brussels decision, and this should take place at the Sunday Meeting,
Monsieur Rappard urged that it was not wise tc give the Mandates question to a separate Committee. There was the danger three if this were done, the Committee would bo regarded as of secondary importance and only those Delegates would attend it who desired to promote a national policy on the subject. Ho wondered whether it would to possible to add the Armenian question to the work of that Committee.
oho ,,„.
5
|r,c S ce rc t ar y- G on cr al said that in order to get the subject treated 4y the Assembly at all. it had been necessary to induce the Council lo say thst they would refer it to the Assembly but towards the end of the Meeting„ This seemed to mho It necessary to have a separate Ic remit toe on the subject, Further, if it were placed f^s one subject Imcngst several to be dealt with by one Coor.ittoc, it would probably le referred to a sub-Committee and the danger that Mons1 cur Rappard lor.rod would be in that ease still more acute. As regards the Cha irmarMs statement on Mandates, this need be nothing more than a loneral essay on the subject.
Sir Herbort Amos said that the Budget Committee would probably psk questions about our internal method of account keeping. In case lhoy did so, ho was having a scheme drawn up which he would circulât 1: all Directors, and he asked that Directors should express their Views upon it.
Dr .Ilitcbe said that many of the States asking for admission vers sending representatives to be heard. These would doubtless I. heard by his Committee. Would thc-y also bo heard by the whole Issenbly? It was agreed that this was a matter for the Assembly as 1 whole- to decide. It would probably accept the recommendation ere the Committee on each ease.
Monsieur Manteux suggested that the telegram from the Austrian lorcign Minister should be circulated at once, wit’ out waiting for ■he ir definite application. This was agreed to.
Mr, Cobban said that Signor Tittoni wanted the Minority Treatio ■ith Jugo-Slavia and Czocho-Slovakia to be taken under the League's «uarantce as soon as possible. This had now been ratified by the
countries,, ,
6
countries concerned, and by Great Britain and Japan, though the ..r boor’s ratification had not yet been deposited. They would soon corec before the Italian Parliament. He thought that there was no objection to Signor Titteni's proposal and would hare all papers ready for Sunday afternoon. It should not trie the Council more than ton minutes.
He wanted advice regarding the number of copies of the final text of the official Journal for the Assembly, which should be presented. This was referred to Hr.Colban to Monsieur Comert and to Sir Herbert •Vmes
»
whose decision should be final
