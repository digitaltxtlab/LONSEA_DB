COMITE IBS DIRECTEURS - 13 JANVIER 1926,
Assistaient à la séance:
le Secrétaire général, le Secrétaire général adjoint, Prof. Attolico,
M. Colban,
M. Comert,
Tr. Van Hamel,
M, Hant rux,

1.	Le Secrétaire général signale, à propose de la nouvelle de lrAgencs Reuter d'après laquelle la Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du Désarmement pourrait être ajournée qu'aucune demande n ra été reçue pour changer la date primitive ment fixée du 15 février. Aussi nTa-t-il pas cru devoir demander de renseignements autrement pua par une lettre privée adressée à lord Cecil.
2.	Un ajournement de la session présenterait incontestablement des difficultés. En mars, il y a déjà la pue st ion de lTAssemblée extraordinaire pour 1T admission de l'Allemagne. Sera-t-elle fixée au 8, jour où commence le Conseil, ou 3 ou
4 jours auparavant ? Il semble pue le plus sage serait de la fixer au 8. Il ne faudra qu'un jour pour admettre l'Allemagne; ensuite le Conseil devra se réunir au sujet de la Question du siège permanent. Il faut remarquer d'autre part eue l’ordre du pour du Conseil n'est pas très chargé; il ne comporte pas de grandes questions comme en décembre dernier: armements, Conférence Economique. On pourrait essayer do terminer les deux sessions, celles de l'Assemblée et du Conseil en 10 jours.
qui concerna la data,
sera tien entendu,
Un ce

08
faire connaître leur api-iis veulent commencer jour avant que le Roprésen-■3 ux ou attendre qu’il soit
entré au Conseil.
3.	Sir Herbert Ames signale que sa section devra com-
mencer à préparer le budget de 1927 vers la milieu de février en vue de la réunion de la Commission de Cùntroie en avril. Devra-t-il tenir compte> des dépenses supplémentaires qu'occasionnera l'entrée de* l'Allemagne ou les réserver pour un document supplémentaire qui serait préparé ultérieurement ?
Le Secrétaire général fait remarquer qu'auparavant, il y aura lieu de soumettre à l'Assemblée spéciale un projet de budget supplémentaire pour l'année 1926, toujours en raison de l'entrée de l'Allemagne, étant bien entendu qu'aucun des membres de la Société n'aura à verser pour cela de contribution supplémentaire. A la suite d'une discussion à laquelle prennent part le Secrétaire général MM. Avenol, Attolico et Van Hamel, il est décidé que les sections feront connaître leurs besoins en tenant compte de l'entrée de l'Ailemagne lorsque le Service financier leur demandera, vers la mi-février, leurs prévisions budgétaires. Chacun des Directeurs saura à ce moment-là de quel personnel il a besoin et les sections qui assurent le secrétariat de commissions dans lesquelles pourraient entrer des membres allemands, par exemple la Section Economique et Financière, seront également en mesure de faire les prévisions nécessaires.
3
4,	Le Secrétaire Général annonce on'il se rendra
samedi à Paris, ainsi eue L, Avepol, pour assister à l'inauguration de l'Institut International de Coopération Intellectuelle au Palais Royal.
5c	Sur la demande du Secrétaire Général, le pi. Van
Hamel fait connaître l'état des négociations avec le Gouvernement suisse au sujet des privilèges des fonctionnai res du Secrétariat. La dernière lettre de Berne reçue avant-hier confirme l’accord intervenu mais ne donne 'uoun renseignement sur le point en litige au sujet des impôts à payer par les fonctionnaires suisses. La date limité prévue pour un arrangement est le 15 janvier, au delà de laquelle le S., G» devra se mettre en rapport avec les membres du Conseil, mais il est à supposer que d'ici là, on aura reçu une nouvelle lettre du Gouvernement suisse.
6.	A propos d'un Congrès de presse oui l'a- consulté pour savoir s'il devrait se réunir à Genève pendant l'Assemblée, k„ Comert demande quelle doit être l'attitude du Secret ri t;
au point de vue publicité, il y a quelquefois des confusions entre les décisions de l'assemblée et celles de ces Congrès lorsqu'ils se tiennent en même temps qu'elle .
Le Secrétaire Général est d'avis que le Secrétariat ne doit pus en principe prendre position à ce sujet sous peine de soulever toutes sortes de difficultés. On pourrait cependant faire ressortir eue si de tels congrès étaient tenus pendant 1.saemblée, de sérieux problèmes de logement pourraient en résulter .
7.	k. Haas donne quelques renseignements sur la réunion qui se tient en ce moment à Ltrasbourg pour l'unification du droit privé en matière de navigation intérieure. Ce n'est qu'une réunion préliminaire oui ne pourra au'amorcer des travaux ultérieurs .
4
Il	signele à ce propos ou'il n'y a eu aucune difficulté avec la Bépublique des Goviets qui a envoyé un représentant. C'est une confirmation de l'attitude prise par le Gouvernement de Moscou dont les délégués * au cours des précédentes réunions techniques en matière de transit auxquelles ils ont assisté, ont fait
connaître que leur -Gouvernement collaborerait à toutes les Questions
\
sans caractère politique traitées pat la Société des Hâtions et auxquelles il s'estimerait intéressé» sous réserve bien entendu du lieu de la réunion*
8.	a ce propos, le Dr. Van Hamel demande si la lettre
de 1*1. Motte au Secrétaire Général expliquant l'attitude du Gouvernement suisse vis-à-vis des représentants des Soviets ‘.;uxnuels ce Gouvernement reconnaît les mêmes privilèges ou'à tous les °utr©s délégués aux réunions de la Société des Nations est entièrement satisfaisante. Il lui semble qu'étant donné l'hostilité manifeste entre la Suisse et la Russie des Soviets, d'autres assurances auraient dû être données.
.après une discussion, le Secrétaire Général, M. bvenol,
M. ^ttolico, estiment qu'il faut distinguer soigneusement entre les relations de la Suisse et de l£ Bépublique des Soviets en tant que gouvernements et les relations de la République des Soviets et de la Société des Hâtions, ue Secrétariat ne peut se placer qu'à ce dernier peint de vue; la lettre de H, Motta qui s-sure un même traitement aux délégués des Soviets qu'aux autres délégués a été publiée dans la presse et il n'y a pour le moment aucune autre initiative à prendre.
9.	M. Golban rappelle qu'il aura à aoumettn ultérieurement
à un Comité des Directeurs certaines aî: s tiens n sujet du Registry ( système d'enregistrement., utilisation du Registry par les sections qui devraient lui confier tous les dossiers sauf les lettres privées }B
O -
Kala cette question se posera naturellement quand le chef actuel du Registry, nui doit rentrer dans son pays, ouittera ses fonctions*
10.	üU Colban, à propos lu Comité qui a été constitué réo'mirent pour étudier la question des ventes de publications de in Société,
4émondé s'il ne pourrait pas étudier aussi la question de 1 ’ impression des procès-verbaux du Conseil. Il est désirable pour la publicité que les documents imprimés soient le plus vite possible à la disposition du Secrétariat.
D’une discussion à laquelle prennent pcrt le Prof.bttolico, Sir Herbert innés et il. Haas, il résulte que l’impression d‘ .. documents est souvent retardée du fait que les manuscrits des sections appellent des corrections d’épreuves nombreuses » Il faut toutefois i :rmia que, dans certains cas, ces retards viennent aussi de c nue les Gouvernements n’ envoient pas en uerups voulu les documents indispensables .
De Secrétaire Gré né r al estime ope cette ouest ion ne doit pas etre étudiée par le Comité de vente des publications, mais par le Professeur Attolico oui pourra s’adjoindre pour cela 3 ou 4 membres du Secrétariat,
iiii. Iran toux profite de cette occasion pour -nnonct r que le Comité de vente se réunira probablement vers Ir fin du mois, qu,vnd son secrétaire, il. Pelt, aura pu préparer toute la. documentation et les bases de discussion nécessaires.
11.	Sir Herbert Ames f• it ressortir l'état très fnvor ble des finances de la Société. Un peu plus de 19 millions ont été versés sur l’exercice 1925 pendant le courant de 1 ’• nnée. I' rgentine a versé sa contribution de l'an dernier.
12*	le Dr. van Hamel annonce que le Comité de Codifie tion
du Droit International s’est réuni oe matin et eue ses tr veux dureront environ 15 jours.

Le Secrétaire Général demande aux Directeurs de faire parvenir aussitôt que possible au Comité de rédaction, la liste des questions qui devront être inscrites à l'ordre du jour du Conseil le 8 mars. L’ordre du jour provisoire pourrait être discuté à la prochaine réunion du Comité des Directeurs, et envoyé au Président vers le 1er février.
Il désirerait examiner certaines questions relatives à la procédure de l’Assemblée extraordinaire. Si, comme on peut s’y attendre, la demande d’admission de l'Allemagne est reçue aux environs du 1er février, le Conseil se réunira le 5 ou le 6 février pour décider la convocation de l'Assemblée extraordinaire et arrêter son ordre du jour.
L’Assemblée extraordinaire serait ouverte per le Président du Conseil en exercice, mais devrait ensuite élire un Président. Comme il n'existe aucun précédent, le Secrétair
Général consulte les directeurs sur la procédure à suivre. Il lui semble que deux commissions seulement devr ient être créées-; une commission politique ou d’admission, une commission financière ou du budget. Les présidents de ces deux commissions et les six vice-présidents de l’assemblée seraient élus et constitueraient, avec le Président, un bureau suffisamment fort. On peut penser que les membres permanents du Conseil et deux Américains seraient élus vice-présidents, les deux présidents des commissions étant des personnalités d’ expé-rienoe, au courant des travaux antérieurs de la Société,
Ba oe qui concerne la date de convocation de 1 ’Assemblée., le Secrétaire Général envisage trois possibilités--; oonvoquer lrassemblée pour le 4 mars, oe qui obligerait à convoquer en même temps le Conseil; la réunir le 8 mars comme le Conseil, les deux organismes siégeant en même temps; ou la tenir seulement après le Conseil vers le 15 mars, Le Secrétaire général serait plutôt en faveur de le deuxième solution. L'ordre du jour du Conseil semblant devoir être pou chargé, les deux réunions ne dureraient sans doute qu’une dizaine de jours,
u» bantoux a soulevé-, dans une note ¿au Secrétaire Général, la question de la consultation de là Conférence des ambassadeurs et de la Commission des Réparations sur l'exécution par l’Allemagne de ses obligations internationales. Le Secrétaire ■Général pensé que si cette consultation n'est demandée por aucun Dtàt,. il serait préférable do h’ en pas parler, les principaux signataires intéressés du Traité de Versailles étant représentés à l’Assemblée,
6.	A la suite d 'une discussion à laquelle prennent part
1,1.	Van H area 1, M. Van Hamel, M. Attolico at Sir Arthur liai ter, l'opinion du Secrétaire Général sur la composition du. bureau de l'Assemblée extraordinaire est adoptée.
7*	Sir Arthur Jalter fait observer que la convocation simul-
tanée de l’Assemblée et du Conseil pour le 8 muta obligerait le Conseil à ajourner l’étude de certaines questions importantes, pour ne les discuter qu'après l'entrés de 1 Ai lie magne au Conseil. On pourrait certes traiter dès le début certains point de l’ordre du jour, mais non des problèmes comme celui de la Hongrie, de l’Autriche, ni peut-être meme de la. Grèce.
Le Secrétaire général croit que de telles questions, qui ne sont que la continuation de l’activité antérieure du Conseil, pourraient être étudiées avant ,meme l’entrée de l'Allemagne; mais il préfère attendre l’établissaient de l'ordr du .jour avant de se prononcer.
M. Attolico remarque que le Conseil lui-même pourrait d’ailleurs décider d'ajourner l’examen de certaines questions.
8.	Sur la demande de Sir Arthur Salter, le Secrétaire Général expose les raisons pour lesquelles il croit nécessaire d'avoir une réunion spéciale du Conseil au début de février pour décider la convocation de l’Assemblée, bn vote de majorité doit être obtenu et des décisions doivent être prises en ce qui con~ carne la date et l’ordre du jour de cette Assamblée.
9.	M. Attolico revient sur la question de la noto.de
IA lianthoux. Puisque de toutes façon la C.P.C. doit donner un «.vis sur l’observation par l’Allemagne de ses engagements internationaux, conformèrent è l’article 1er du Pacte, il
serait peut-être préférable de consulter auparavant la Conférence des Ambassadeurs et la Commission ¿es Réparations pour ne prs avoir à le faire pendant la réunion.
Le Secrétaire Général fait observer pue la Conférence des ambassadeurs est composée des puissances oui ont pris part aux négociations de Locarno. Il ns croit donc pas que la question îpuisso se poser, à moins qu’un Etat non représenté à Locarno ne la soulève* juø 1 Ton considère la Conférence des Ambassadeurs comme n’ayant pas d’existence .juridique distincte des principales Puissances alliées qui la composent, ainsi que le croit Sir Arthur Saltør, ou comme un organisme spécial char gé par ces Puissances d’exercer leurs pouvoirs en leur nom, ainsi que le pensa U. Van Kamel, le Secrétaire Général estime qu'il vaudrait mieux éviter une consultation officielle.
LL Mantoux explique qu’on peut se placer dans l’hypothèse où certains Etats préféreraient constater que l'Allemagne” est considérée par les signataires des Traités de paix comme ayant rempli ses obligations”, plutôt que déclarer eux-mêmes qu’elle les a remplies. C'est une question ¿issez délicate de nuance, et pour cela il serait peut-être utile de pouvoir faire état de documents établis avant sinon pendant la »réunion
3ur demande de la. Attolico, il. Mathenet indique que la C.P.C. n’a pas à juger de 1’ accomplissement par l’Allemagne de ses obligations, mois doit fixer son statut militaire; elle se contentera naturellement de constater qu'il est arreté par le Traité. Il rappelle que, dans le cas de la Hongrie, pour savoir si ce statut était effectivement en vigueur, un échange de télégrammes a du avoir lieu avec la Conférence des Ambassadeurs.
5
10.
i
Le Secrétaire erénéral re pense pas que le eus de la Hongrie constitue un précédent et ^référerait éviter si possible toute discussion technique à l'occasion de la réunion de l'assemblée
Sir Arthur SALTER remarque eu'en ce qui concerne la Commission des Réparations, elle aune existence juridique bien définie et une mission clairement indiquée. Une déclaration de sa part pourrait offrir certains avantages, dans le cas où quelque Etat élèverait des critiques.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL lui répond et répond è Sir Herbert Ames qu'il convient d'attendre la demande d'admission do lEAlema?ne oui contiendra, reut-être une déclaration sur son désir sincère d'exécuter ses obligations internationales.
M. Emis, tout en étant d'accord avec lu proposition pour la composition du bureau de l'Assemblée, se demande si une troisième commission, la commission juridique, no devrait pas être envisagée.
M. IA.NTOUX estime que le Comité d'admission aura le pouvoir de régler les questions juridiques qui se poseraient éventuellement.
11.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL ajourne la discussion sur 1s question des nouveaux batiments.
12.	En réponse à une question de Sir Arthur Salter, il
informe le Comité qu'un échange de vues semble avoir lieu entre Etats sur la date de la réunion du Comité préparatoire de la Conférence du Désarmement, primitivement fixée au 15 février. Sir Austen Chamberlain profitera, sans doute de son passe<?e à Paris pour discuter la question avec le Gouvernement français. l'entrée prochaine de l'Allemagne dans la Société, les incidents "endants
B
entre la Suisse et l'U0R<.S0S. , »paraissent dans certains milieux justifier un ajournement de la réunion» Sir Arthur Salter raprell que le Comité préparatoire de la Conférence Economique doit se réunir le 15 avril.
Le SBGHET.-IHS GENERAL estime donc que si lu réunion du désarmement était ajournée, elle devrait 1* être jusqu'au début de mai. Une décision devra intervenir prochainement afin que les représentants des v'uys éloignés puissent etre prévenus en temps utile; si aucun Etat no prend l'initiative de demander l'ajournement, il est possible qu'intervienne une demande collective émanant de plusieurs Etats.
M, lu LIT OU X annonce la. réception d'un télégramme do le Commission de l'Irak disant que tout va bien. Tour éviter des discussions dans la presse turque, il estime qu'il est préférable de ne pas communiquer ce télégramme à la presse ot de le considérer comme une information d'ordre administratif»
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL rarta^e cet avis, tout en se demandant si ce télégramme no sera nas oublié par ailleurs.
Le Ir. Norman WHITE donne des nouvelles do la mission du Dr. Rejchman, et annonce son retour h Genève pour la fin du mois. Il entretient é-raiornent le Comité des discussions qui viennent de se tenir à La Haye au sujet de la vaccination antivariolique et de ses conséquences, Une enquête a été décidée sur cette question, oui est pardeo secrète par le Comité d'Hygiène.
Sir Herbert- AMES demande si un budget supplémentaire pour 1926 doit etre préparé par sa Section pour tenir compte des conditions financières nouvelles après l'entrée de l'Allemagne.
Il est décidé {¡près un échancc- do vues, que soûles des prévisions globales peuvent être faites à l’heure actuelle, et ou'il serait trop tôt pour entrer déjà dans les détails.
16.	M. 1TIT0BE rend compte de la dernière réunion du
Comité international de Coopération intellectuelle. Il annonce l'inauguration officielle de l'Institut international de Co>< (opération intellectuelle à Péris, l'étude par la Commission des proîots de st;tut de l'Institut de droit international priv^ à créer à Rome et la nomination de II.

Directors Meeting 154 ANNEX.
DIRECTORS AND GHEES PS SECTIONS;
On reading through the minutes of the last Directors Meeting, I feel that perhaps the discussion at one moment developed cn somewhat wrong lines, owing to forgetfulness on our part as to the exact contents of Article I of the Covenant., If that Article is read, it will he seen that all that is required for the admission of a new Member is that "it shall give effective guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its international obligations and shall accept such regulations as may be prescribed by the league in regard to its military, naval and air forces and armaments,"
But there is nothing in the article requiring a guarantee for membership that it has already fulfilled all the international obligations into which it has up to the present entered.
This being so, I do not think it necessary either that any statement should be made formally by the other Powers Signatories of the Treaty of Versailles or by Germary herself. There are, of course, the precedents of Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary; but if I remember rightly, in these cases certain Powers definitely wished for their own purposes to take the opportunity provided of raising the question. This of course they had a perfect right to .do before giving their vote; and enquiry was accordingly made in order to ascertain the facts. But the question as such does not occur in the Covenant, and therefore unless it is specifically raised by some Member of the league, it can and should, I think, remain in total abeyance.

Mr, Wilson, Secretary.
1.	The SECJBTARY-OEilEBAL, referring to the request of
five members of the Council for an adjournment of the meeting of the Preparatory Committee for Disarmament, said that it would be useful to form an idea of the date on which this Committee should sit.
After some discussion it was decided that the suggestion might be made to the Council to convene the meeting of the Committee for April 12th or May 6th, the latter date being preferable unless the first could be defini te ly maintained .
A second postponement should he avoided at all costs. The Economic Preparatory Committee might then postpone the meeting which had been provisionally arranged and it was agreed that the Economic Preparatory Committee should be convoked for April 26th.
The SECRETABY-GEIÎERAL said that he had no definite news concerning the date on which the German application might he expected 0 If it arrived quite early next week it would still he possible to hold a meeting of the Council at the end of the week and to convoke the Assembly to meet during the ¿'arch session of the Council, It was, however, essential that three weeks should elapse between the convocation of the special Assembly and its meeting.
The SECBLTjLRY-GEIIEB AL asked directors to expedite the preparation of Council documents for the A'arch session.
The 3 E C HA TALI Y - GhliEB Al referred to the exchange of minutes which had taken place concerning the attendance of members of the Secretariat at meetings of international organisations having a special political colour at which questions interesting the League were discussed - for instance, the meeting of the International Socialist Congress. It should bo remembered that to such meetings members of the Secretariat wore not usually invited and therefore all they could do there was to fellow the proceedings informally and make personal contacts.
Professor ATTOLICO thought there was no fundamental difference of opinion on what should be thu nature of this liaison, It was necessary to dispel the idea, that the Secretariat should make efforts to keep in touch with Socialist international organisations more than with those of other political opinions. The probability, alleged by seme but questioned by himself that the Socialist star was in the ascendant was irrelevant. Provided that it was realised that liaison with party international gatherings required great discretion and provided that it was made clear that the League was not identified with one party more than another, ho made no objection to this liaison on principle.
¿i. COiniRT explained that the reason why liaison with Socialist international gatherings attracted greater notice was that the Socialist and Labour parties were more highly
*
organised internationally thampartics of different views«
If the Radicals or Conservatives held international congresses the League should keep in touch with them also» Fe thought it useful that a member of the Secretariat should be there in the. background at Congresses of this kina as he might work in various ways in the interests of the League. It was by nc means necessary and sometimes inadvisable to attempt to force the name of the League into the proceedings of those congiesses»
Sir Arthur S^LTuK said that there were: two alternative courses of action open to the Secretariat in this matter, namely, equal treatment of-all political parties and complete abstention from contact with them. He greatly hoped that the first would continue to be followed.
A discussion having begun on the acceptability of the United States reservations concerning the Permanent Court of International Justice, the GnCRBT\EY-GEIILRAL asked that it might be postponed until the exact nature of these reservations was known.
	Dr . V an HU	YLL	said that the	mccting	of the Committee on
the	Codifiesti on	of	In tor national	Law had	ended. The Committee
had	proposed tha	t 11	1-. ir stud i s sr	:ould be	submitted for
consideration to the lc". emmets, only me of them ( that cn diplomatic privileges) being put forward as having their co Hoc tire approval, the remaining seven being simply reports prepared under the personal authority of their authors.

il. Ox'iLSSCU s lid that ho had recently toon in Spain where he had established contacts with intellectuals.
He found them sympathetic towards the League and anxious to know about it but living rather apart from the main current of Luropoan international life.
He had also attended the international students' meeting at Bordeaux. The students had also shewn a desire to collaborate with the League and had discussed the;, question of Gorman as an official langauge. If there was one official language; they agreed that it should be french, but if there wore mere than one they thought German should be amongst them.
8.	Sir Herbert AILES deplored the fact that so many members
of the Secretariat did not belong to the Sick Benefit fund.
If these members fell ill the League might bo called upon to m^ke a donpassdonate grant ana it was to ^>void this that the Assembly had agreed to contribute towards the Sick Benefit .Fund The SBCRLTaRY-GLBEKAL asked Professor Attolico to consider the possibility of drawing up a statement explaining that the continued contribution of the League to the Fund depended upon its support by the menbers of the Secretariat, and making it clear that the Idministraticn wore powerless to aid in case of sickness those who wore not contributors
to the fund.

l.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was still
expected that the Special Assembly would meet on March 8th. It would be convenient that the Assembly should meet first in the afternoon, a meeting of the Council being held in the morning.
II,	The advisability of holding in public the Special
Session of the Council convoked for February 12th was
discussed
-2-
It was agreed, that while a public session would forestall a possible criticism of the League's action, it might stimulate some of the representatives of the members of the Council, most of whom would be sitting on the Council for the first time, to make speeches, which might not be opportune. Consequently it was thought better that	the meeting should be held	in private.
III.	The Special meeting of the	Council would be	asked	to
place on the Agenda of the General Sssernbly the conclusions of the Jury of Architects.
IV.	There was some discussion on the question of what
would bo the designation of the meeting of the Assembly which would probabljr be held in Ilarch.
h. COI.IERT thought that it	would be logical	that
this	session should take its place in the series	of sessions
of the Assembly and so be called the Seventh Session of the Assembly:	thus the analogy of the Council would be followed.
Dr. Van RAVEL said that in theory the Assembly was a standing body having sessions from time to time. In practice, however, each Assembly had been regarded as distinct and called "First Assembly", "Second Assembly" etc. The question of the best name to give to the march Assembly was therefore not so simple.
M. COLLAN said that if the analogy of national parliaments were followed, the special session would not have a separate number; it would be called a "Special Session of the 1926 (i.e. the Seventh) Assembly".
Sir Herbert AI'ES said that in his experience each session of a parliament, special or not, had its own number.
-3-
Dr. RAJCHMAN thought that "Special Assembly" meant an emergency meeting summoned in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 1 of the Rules of Procedure; that is, on the request of a Member; and not, as in the present case, by a decision of the Council.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL was opposed to numbering the March Assembly in a series of General Assemblies. He considered it as a special session of the Assembly held in 1926.
Professor ATTOLICO was also of that opinion.
The discussion both on the particular question of the name of the March Assembly and of the general question whether, for administrative purposes, the Assembly should be considered as a standing body like the Council, meeting in sessions (general or special) from time to time, or a kind of phoenix existing for some four weeks in the autumn of each year, was not continued. The final decision was left to the Secretary-General and the Legal Director.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he did not intend to apply to the Conference of Ambassadors or elsewhere for documents relating to Germany's armaments or to reparations which the Assembly might wish to consult. However, he asked the Disarmament and Financial Sections to see to it that the Library had all public or semi-public documents of this kind.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that in his opinion it was necessary under Article 9 of the Covenant that the question of the regulations to be laid down by the League with regard to German armaments should be referred, if only for form's sake, to the Permanent Advisory Commission. He did not, however, think it necessary to place on the Agenda of the
VII.
VIII.
IX.
-4-
Special Session of the Council the question of convoking the Commission. The Members of the Council should be asked, unofficially to send their military advisers along with their representatives to the March Session. It would thus be possible for the Council at its meeting on the morning of March 8th to refer the question to the Permanent Advisory Commission and obtain an answer that day.
Professor ATTOLICO asked what should members of tho Secretariat say if they were asked privately for their advice on the size of delegations to the Special Assembly.
The DEPUTY SECRDTARY-OExIDRAL thought that -enquiring Governments might be told privately that not more than two Committees were expected to meet at the Assembly and that two delegates for each Member would probably be sufficient.
The SECRETARY- GENERAL added that some such indication should also be givna in sending out the Agenda.
In reply to a question, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Special Assembly would be held in the Salle de la Reformation.
The meeting then discussed the question as to where the German representative should sit at the Council table.
Two theories were opposed: first, that he should sit last of the-representatives of the Permanent Members; second, that he should sit last of the representatives 5f all the Members.
Dr. van HAMEL maintained that at the Council table itself there was no difference of rank between Permanent and non-
Permanent Members.
Dr. RAJCHIIAN asked why the alphabetical order which applied to the Assembly was not applied to the Council.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL replied that at the Second Session of the Council the French representative, who had presided at the First Session, took his place at the right of this new President-.
II.	COMER? thought that it was important that it should not appear that any radical change in the sitting order of the Council had been introduced as the result of Germany's entry.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GEUERAL thought that the following two facts were of importance:	first, that hitherto no
question of precedent had arisen at the Council: second that the Permanent Members had not been grouped together,
It was agreed that this was a matter for the Council itself to decide and that it would be wise for the Council to discuss it privately at the meeting on the morning of March 8th.
II.	COMERT thought that it would create a good impression if in future the representatives of ad hoc Members of the Council should sit amongst the other representatives and not as at present facing them like culprits.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked that the 'proper department of the Secretariat should see whether a horse-shoe table for the Council could be arranged before the march Session.
M. MAiTTOUX said that it had been - arranged to distribute the translation of th’s German letter of application with the original German text as an annex.
M. COLDAN protested. Many official letters in German had been received by his Section and had never been reproduced in League documents.
-6-
XI.
XII.
!'. MADARIAGA said that to reproduce the German text would be to encourage other countries whose language was not an official language, to communicate with the League in their own language.
Frofessor ATTOLICO suggested that a footnote should be added to the communication to the members of the League to the effect that the original German text was kept in the archives of the Secretariat at the disposal of the members of the Leag,ue.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed. He said that he had already telegraphed to the Members of the Council that they would receive the German text but this could be communicated to them privately.
II. GILCHRIST said that H, Zeau would be unable to be present at the forthcoming session of the Mandates Commission and the Frasident of the Council had approved the nomination of M. Roume as his substitute,
Mr. COLIAH	said that a meeting of the Minorities
Committee would be held in Paris on the 22nd February. It was now normal that such meetings should be he Id between sessions of the Council. Therefore, from the fact that minorities questions appeared comparatively seldom or) the Agenda of the Council it was not to be inferred that the League's interest in minorities was asleep.

OF TNG DIRECTORS' MEETING, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5rd,192G,
■Present:	The Secretary-General.
Dr . N i t o b e Sir Herbert Ames M. Coiii6rt M. Colban Sir Arthur Salter M. Madariaga Mr. McKinnon Wood Dr . Norman G’hi t e M. Quesnay la. Righetti M. Pietromarchi Mr. Wilson (Secretary).
1.	The provisional agenda of the 39th Session of the Council was examined from the point of view of the order
in which items should be considered. Certain changes were proposed, to be embodied in a revised provisional agenda.
2.	It was decided that it was described that by some method or ether the satisfactory winding up of the Greco-3ulgaria affair should be reported to the Council.
3.	The Secretary-General said that the President of the Assembly in his speech suggesting the distribution of the items of the Agenda amongst the Assembly Commissions, should perhaps propose that on Item 2 "Decisions of the Assembly on Council Proposals, if any, in Application of Article 4 of the Covenant «f the League of Nations", it might be left to the General Committee of the Assembly to make suggestions to the Assembly so soon as the proposals expected had been made by the
Counc i1.
-2-
4.	The Secretary-General said that he had been received in a friendly manner by the German Government in his recent visit to Berlin. He had made known to them his intentions concerning the posts which might be given to Germans in the Secretariat after the admission of Germany to the League, and had come to the conclusion that it was desirable to appoint as soon as possible a German Under-Secretary-General.
The present Government was committed to a League policy and expected that after six months of successful co-operation with other Governments in the League, it would have much greater support from the nation as a whole for such a policy.
The personnel of the Government was badly informed concerning League procedure. For instance the Foreign Minister had quite misunderstood the bearing of the changes in minorities’ procedure adopted by the Council last year, but seemed satisfied with the Secretary—General's explanations of them.
5.	In reply to Sir Herbert Ames the Secretary-General said he had no reason to expect special difficulties in the adoption of the supplementary budget.
6.	Some comments having been made on the question of the site for the Assembly Hall, the Secretary-General said that he thought it important that the Secretariat should appear to have no preference for either of the two solutions proposed.
7.	M. Kantoux said that he had heard that the German delegates would only take their place in the Assembly Hall after the election of Germany to a seat on the Council.
- 3 ~
The Seorstary-Gcner al thought that this would not he so. Ho had explained in Berlin to the apparent satisfaction of the Government, what seemed to be the only right procedure, viz. that immediately after the admission of Germany to the League, the German delegates should take their seats.
8.	In reply to K. Mantoux, the Secretary-General said that the German Government hoped not to be asked questions by the Sub-Committee of the Assembly Commission which would consider its request tor admission of a kind which would necessitate their making a statement of any importance. Otherwise they would feel bound to make some declaration about war guilt.
It was therefore yery desirable that the Subcommittee on which he hoped some of the most influential delegates in the Assembly would sit should frame its questions to the German Government with great care.
9.	In reply to M. Madariaga, the Secretary-General said that it was expected that the Members of the Council would bring with them their military advisers, so that the P.A.C. could be convened by 'the Council at a momentTs notice. The best procedure (though it had^been questioned whether this would be technically correct) seemed to he that the Council should ask the P.A.C. for a report, which it would immediately transmit to the Assembly.
M. Madariaga hoped that the terms of reference to the P.A.C. v/ould not be in the same form as those used on the occasion of the admission of Hungary. He thought that some vague formula, such as ,Taux fins de l1 article I", would be the best.
The Scoretary-Gencral thought; it better that the P.A.C. should be asked a question reproducing the relevant
4
part of \rticle I, so that it could report that it noted that Germany’s armaments were regulated by treaty and therefore had no other observations to make.
10.	In reply to Mr. McKinnon Wood, the Secretary-General said that he thought that the earliest day on
which Germany could be admitted would be Wednesday, March 10th.
11.	Sir Herbert Ames asked the .Directors to send in their estimated for the 1927 Budget as soon as possible, -
in any case directly after the Special Session of the Assembly.

1,	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that immediately after
the end of the special session of the Assembly a week ago he had felt that the adjournment of Germany's admission was a grave blow to the League.	The situation was still
obviously not without danger, but there were now good reasons for taking' a much more hopeful view of it.
In the first place the greatest disaster which it was feared might follow the adjournment had, so it seemed, been aver.ted. The approval by a largo majority of the Reichstag of the Government1 s-League policy showed that the events of the Assembly had not produced in Germany any revulsion of feeling against what might be called the League and Locarno policy of Germany. It should be remembered that even if Brazil had withdrawn her veto the admission of Germany would have taken place in very unfavourable circumstances.
For instance, it might well have boon followed by the withdrawal
of two itemcers of the League from active participation in its work, and possibly their withdrawal from membership.
He had been informed on good authority that the German delegation had expressed the opinion that they would prefer Germany's admission not to take place at the moment if in addition to the resignations of Sweden and Czechoslovakia from the Council, such was to be the result of it.
Two criticisms had been particularly made against the conduct of the negotiations. In the first place it was said that the Assembly had not been properly prepared.
This, he thought, was unjust criticism.	The members of
the Council, except Brazil, did not know the terms of the Brazilian reply to Germany, and even if they had known those terms, they would probably not have inferred that Brazil would veto the granting of a permanent seat to Germany. Prom the fact that Brazil had concurred in the Council's reply to Germany in March 1925 and in the summoning of a special Assembly to admit Germany, it had been assumed that she would not go so far as to oppose this admission on the only terms on which it was possible. The maintenance of the veto was therefore a complete surprise. Had the real situation been recognised, the Locarno powers would certainly never have agreed to the convocation of the Special Assembly, before a solution of the difficulty had been found.
Secondly, complaints were made that the Assembly had been given no chance to help in overcoming the difficulty. ( He was not prepared to say that there was no justification for such complaints, but it should not be forgotten that the whole character of the negotiations was unique. The Council had no formal call to consider the granting of a permanent seat to Germany until Germany became a Member of the League.
3
He hoped that the true solution of the difficulty would be found by the Committee set up to consider the constitution of the Council. If this Committee carried out its task in an impartial spirit and with a view to the general interests of the League rather than the ambitions of particular claimants, the whole difficulty might be satisfactorily solved, and the present setback might prove in the long run to be an advantage. The establishnent of this Committee brought the whole problem within the competence of the League and its machinery could now'properly be utilized. Up to now the fact that the Locarno agreements had been concluded outside the League had lead to something like conflicting jurisdiction.
3f. Fill TO UX agreed that the situation at present seemed to be less dangerous than might have been apprehended last week. Great care should be taken to avoid the difficulties and dangers still ahead of us. Much had be,en said about the lack of publicity and its disastrous effects, bu.t as a matter of fact secrecy and publicity had done equal harm, the most important question being perhaps to know when either would be useful or otherwise.
There is no doubt that the Press controversy which took place just before the Assembly had the effect merely of stiffening each Government in its attitude, when the greatest possible freedom of movement was required.
what it was most essential to have cleared up, not only before the next Assembly but possibly before the meeting of the special Commission, was the mutual position of Brazil and the other South American States. The representatives of Brazil, even now, spoke as if they bad acted in the interests of South America as a whole, while the representatives of
4
other South American States had certainly done everything they could during the Assembly not to encourage Brazil , in her uncompromising attitude. It was evident that a solution which would satisfy the Latin American States as a whole would receive very serious consideration, tut it was for them to define that solution between themselves, and to propose it unequivocally, if further trouble was to be prevented.
As for the working of the Commission, no doubt it would have the great advantage of bringing the whole problem under League procedure instead of dealing with it in the style of former diplomatic conferences. But there could hardly be any question of the Commission contemplating real constitutional improvements, because this would mean amending the Covenant, and ihe procedure for amendments precluded the possibility of securing a solution before the next Assembly. If the Commission’s task was limited to discussing the number of permanent and non-permanent scat's, such a discussion would be practically the same as last week, except that algebrical ciphers would replace the names of countries - a transparent disguise’.
The favourable factors were the lesson taught by the recent session, the possibility of a more methodical treatment of the problem, and time, provided no adverse movement of opinion took place in this period of suspense. The first reactions in various countries, including Germany, had not been too disquieting. There was no reason to be pessimistic, although considerable risks still remained, and full light was needed on all points which might still remain more or less obscure.
- 5 -
Sir Arthur 3ALTER viewed the question from threo aspects. Possible criticism of what had happened, the present position, and future prospects.
The substance of the general criticisms was that the moans which the Assembly possessed or bringing pressure to bear on a recalcitrant member had not been used. Simultaneously with the notification of the Brazilian veto came the Locarno communique which was a » clear indication that the principal Powers accepted the adjournment. Thus the moment that the problem had been reduced to the isolated difficulty of the Brazilian veto the Assembly was virtually deprived of the opportunities which it would then have possessed oi helping tov/ards a so lution.
With regard to the present position he thought it necessary that members of the Secretariat should curb the optimism to which their more intimate know ledge of the staying power of the League made them prone and realise how severe a shock to the reputation of the League this adjournment had been. In his opinion the practical
consequences would be that until September the League would be almost impotent for positive work. Certainly as regards Anglo-Saxon end northern countries the League would find that virtue had gone out of it. The leakage oi the Houghton report at this moment was also most unpropitious.
lloreover, within the next six months anything might happen, but as far as he could see anything that was liicely to happen would be bad for the League.	He feared
t*hat in dealing with any quarrels that might arise the League would find that recent events had impaired its energy, just as the original success of Locarno was found to have increased it, when it dealt with the Cue co-Bulgarian dispute.
6
As to future prospects he thought it of crucial importance that Argentine should be represented on the Commission. Lastly, he thought that the League should counteract the now widespread opinion that Brazil was only the tool of more powerful influences. Brazil had taken on herself the responsibility of stating her opposition in public, and friends of the League had the right to cunsicier this to be not only the incidental but the real cause of the breakdown.
He was not pessimistic but he thought that friends of the League should measure the full extent of the damage which had been done to the League.
H. COLLAIT but wished strongly
was loss sad than Sir Arthur Salter, to critise the procedure of the
nego tiations.
In the first place the Assembly resembled the Genoa Conference in this respect, that everything that mattered had been done by a few leading delegates at their hotels.
Secondly, there had been no touch established with the loading delegates at the Assembly. He had no knowledge that the General Committee of the Assembly had been used as it might have been to establish such a contact, or that its composition was such as to make this action possible.
He agreed with the Secretary-General that everything now depended upon the Commission. He hoped good things oi this Commission, as by its institution the whole question would be brought out of the atmosphere of hotel an to-rooms and Supreme Council methods to that of ordinary League procedure. II even thought that the
discussions of the Committee would show that in these circumstances the problem was not as rj »id as it now appeared.
Having1 been in Brazil for several years, he personally was convinced that Brazil was quite capable of making a star’d such as she had made for reasons which appeared good to her, and without the baching of other Powers.
It was becoming so clear that_the world must have an effective league, or else be prepared to drift quickly into a general war, that he hoped that this difficulty would Ipe overcome as former League difficulties had been.
He wished to comment on the following points of
do tail:-
first, he thought it a, little unfortunate that the attitude of the Cera an delegates to the possible retirement of League Members should have influenced the decision of the Council to propose adjournment. It was more respectable for the League to take such decisions solely out of regard to its own members. Secondly, he thought it remarkable that so little should have been known about the facts in important matters; for instance, the actual to no ur of the Brazilian reply to Germany, and the alleged promise by an ail but unanimous Council to Spain in 1911^ The Secretary-General stated that though he remembered the Council Meeting in 1921, at which Spain had been proposed as a permanent member of the Council by the British representative, and had obtained the votes of 7 members, Brazil alone objecting, no record of that Meeting existed in the Secretariat. He hoped that now-a-days there would Lave been a record of such an important meeting«
r-* 8
As a matter of fact the proposal as to Spain had been preceded by a proposal made by Brazil that Spain and Brazil should both be made permanent members, but thig had been rejected by the majority of the Council, only Spain and Brazil Toting in favour,
Ho MADARIASA first observed that in the recent divisions the unity of the Secretariat had not been impaired.
His general comments ’.Tore as follows
First, he personally was glad that the pressure which it was suggested should have been used, was avoided. The desire for pressure was usually caused by impatience, and impatience by the sudden appearance of some unforeseen event. In League matters one should expect the unexpected and he would even be so bold as to lay down the principle that when people began to talk of the need for pressure, the time had come to adjourn.
The use of the veto by a State not a Great Power had caused surprise, but the Great Powers could usually arrange things agreoably to themselves without the veto and the small Powers would probably not dare to make use of it. There remained what might be called an "intermediate- class" of Powers, which, too small to bully and. to great to bend, might on occasion make use of their veto, or of a threat to withdraw. The issue in this case had been confused by public opinion which, especially in England, came to its conclusions by combining that 50# of idealism which suite* it, with that 50# of practical politics which suited it, whereas things would have been much simpler if the different'cases had been based throughout on idealistic or practical grounds, mixture of the two combined objectively.
or on a
}) t
s
- 0 -
Secondly, he would draw attention to a recent suggestion of Count Skrynski that the League should reconsider the use of the veto« It was in the intention of the Covenant that a vetp might be used by a State to protect its own seriously endangered interests, but not to prevent a solution in a.matter of general interest*
Thirdly, with regard to Spain he wished to say that the first delegate of Spain had net authorised anyone to say what Spain would do in certain contingencies, lest the notification of such intention might be interpreted as a threat*
Lastly he would suggest that it might be useful if the members of the Council elected by an Assembly should sit on the Council immediately after their election*
On the last point the SECRET."RY-GENERAL stated that he believed the procedure as to the date on which new Council Kembers should take their seats had been decided by himself in consultation with Dr. van Hamel.
If so, a change in the existing practice could without much difficulty be effected. In any case the point was one which the Committee might well consider.
Professor ATTOLICQ said that if what had happened was really an adjournment as it was supposed to be, there was no need for pessimism. Like H. Hadariaga, he thought that certain psychological factors should be taken into account in considering the situation.	The difference
in mental i ty amongs t b o t-h me mb 3 r s of the Seere tar i at and delegates to the Assembly, was strongly emphasised by the desire of some and the reluctance of others to see pressure put upon an obstructing State by means of open debate in the Assembly, YAhile some countries would be moved from their position by such publicity, others would hold their ground all the more firmly.
Ho disagreed with the criticism that the negotiations had been too little public. He himself had learnt everything that was going on from the newspapers.
The reason of the failure seemed to him to be that all the interested parties had taken up beforehand so rigid a stand that they could not recode. For each it had become a question of national prestige not to move, so much so that even if at the last moment Brazil had withdrawn her veto, the adjournment would nevertheless have been necessary.
He was puzzled to know why BraziL, being aware of the difficulties apart from her own veto, had chosen to take upon herself publicly the odium of obstruction.
He suggested that this fact could be explained from psychological rather than from political motives. Phe Brazilian representative had become so embittered by the vexations to which he was exposed that he relieved himself by making a gesture of public defiance.
Perhaps too little attention had been given to the point raised by the Albanian representative at the AssemblyTs debate, namely that the non-permanent members of the Council were elected especially to represent tho general opinion of the Assembly, and that they exceeded their mandate when they no longer represented this opinion.
As to the future, he agreed that everything depended on the success of the work of the Commission.
Like Sir Arthur Salter, he thought that the League would have to go carefully, particularly as regards Disarmament, during the next few months, and be content with modest results in the various works it had in hand.
11
The SECRETARY-GEIIERAl made the following points in summi ng up the d i s c us s i cn :
fl) Ho hoped that the Secretariat would not be imbued with the idea that the League was weaker ns a result of the Assembly, except perhaps as regards the U.S.4.
He himself thought that if an affair like the Greoo-Bulgarian dispute came before the League it would be just as competently dealt with.
(2)	Like M. Colban, he hiiself was convinced that Brazil had acted upon her own responsibility.
(3)	The crisis had taught the Locarno Powers that they could not give pledges in the name cf the League as a whole.
(4)	Ho did not chink it possible to lay down any general rule about the advisability of using Assembly pressure. He could imagine cases, for instance the imminence of war, when such pressure would be thoroughly jus tifled,
(5)	It was an important fact that Sir Austen Chamberlain had declared that he felt himself no longer bound by such undertakings as he might have given in view of the special circumstances of the last * sociably. So far as he was concerned the Commission would therefore work with a clean sheet.
(6)	The Albanian theory of the special duties of non-permanent members of the Council seemed to him to be untenable legally and practically inadvisable.
2.	In reply to Professor ATTOLICO, The SECRETARY-
GEIILRaL said that the British motion concerning the United States notification regarding netry into the Permanent Court had been sprung upon the Council at the last moment.
12
He did not know if the British Delegation had previously had unofficial consultation with Washington, but he did not think it likely. He would like to make it clear -first, that whether the United States Government accepted the invitation to the Conference on 1st September or not, the Conference would be held, as the replies of the signatories of the Court Protocol to the United States should be unanimous; second, that it was not a League Conference, but simply a Conference of the signatory States and the United States.
M. CO IB AH thought that too great exertions should not be made to dissociate this Conference from its natural connection with the League. The Statute of the Court had been framed by the Assembly of the League.
However embarrassing the fact might be to the United States, the Court was one of the institutions of the League of Hâtions,- and he thought it beneath the dignity of the League to protend otherwise.

Much as I admire the formula in which you have condensed what I said about the Powers cf "intermediate class", I feel that it does not correctly represent what I meant to say, for in saying cf these Powers that "they are too small to bully and too great to bend", I would appear to have implied that the Great Powers "bullied", how what I said,was very correctly summed up by you in the sentence "but the Great Powers could usually arrange things agreeably to themselves without the veto". ly point is precisely that the Great Powers do not need to bully and that it is enough for them to drop a slight hint.
A little further on you say that "issue in this case had been confused by publio opinion
which, especially in England ......". My meaning
in this case would be more correctly represented if the words "especially in England" were dropped out.
(Signed) S. de Madariaga.

Mr« McKinnon Mood Ur„ Posting Ca p ta i a Mathene t M, Que3nay
Mr. Vila on - Secretary.
1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL remarked that the Members of the
Parliamentary Branch of the league of Nations Union in England appeared to have voted on Party lines in the division of the Geneva debate. This showed that Sir Austen Chamberlain had convinced the members of his Party, 3ome of whom had abstained in the vote which took place before he left for Geneva.
2.	The SECRETARY-• GENERAL said that the firs1: draft of the 1927
Budget showed an increase of some 2-g- millions of which some 1 = 800.000 concerned the Secretariat. He felt sure that the delegates at the Assembly would not sanction a total increase of more than what the German contribution might be expected to bo, namely about two millions. It was therefore necessary to reduce the estimates so far as the Secretariat was concerned by at 1 easrfc 300 or 400 thousand francs.
- s
Ec considered that the Budget presented to the Supervisory Committee and the Members of the League should ho drawn up on tho
ass umpt i on that Sc		rmany would	bo a member of	the Lea	gue	of	Estions
next year. On	the	other hand	the Secretariat	should,	as	a	reserve
meas uro, dr aw	up a	Budget rep	resenting the e	stimutos	wh	ich	would
have been submitted if there had boon no question of Germany becoming a member*
Dr., REJCHMAEil ashed whether the entry cf Germany would imply tho addition of any itom to tho Budget apart from the salaries of extra staff.
The S2CBETLRY GrSL'.ürLJ» replied that Germany:s entry would mean an increase in expenses of all kinds, commissions, printing, accomodation etc.
3,	M. CCilZE-îl, referring to the Office Circular whereby members
of the Secretariat had boon informed that the Secretariat would be closed from Good Friday to Easter Monday inclusive, asked whether some official should not bo instructed to como to the Secretariat on S-.turday morning in odder to receive important messages uSpeciall telephone calls, Tho Secretariat would be exposed to criticism if for four days there was no one at tho Secretariat except tho E--11 Porter to answer such calls*

After soir.e discussion the Secretary-General agreed that if the Information Section thought such action necessary for its work, there would "be a telephonist on duty during reasonable hours on Saturday.
As to the advisability of other ir.eri.bers of the Secretariat coir.ing in on Satruday morning to deal with urggnt work, he left it to directors and heads of sections to make such arrangements as they thought necessary. The mail would be distributed to the various sections on Saturday morning.
4.	Mr. HAAS said that he hoped that the for theoming Passport Conference would agree to recommend to Governments that "lettres de Mission" signed by the Secretary-General might in cases of urgency, where it had not been possible for the official concerned to obtain the required visas, be aoceptod in lieu of such visas. He wanted to be sure that there was agreement in the Secretariat about the desirability of taking this step before making the proposal to the Conference.
Ur. RAJCEMANH thought the idea a good one. Indeed on occasions it might be useful for officials of the league on mission to produce, instead of their national passports, a "Lettre de Mission" certifying that he was proceeding on official business of the League.
Mr. HAAS explained that he wanted above all to avoid raising any question of the juridical value of a Secretariat Lettre de Mission. '.Yhut was wanted was an imposing document likely to be accepted at a frontier in lieu of a visa.
The SECRETARY-GEEERAI agreed that there was no need to raiee any juridical question. The whole basis of the proposal was-that if there were urgent reasons why an official should leave on a mission, he should not be delayed in order to obtain the regular visa.

1.	The DEPUTY 3^CPMTLHY-GEILTUJL said that he had
been asked tc preside at the nesting as the Secretary-General was busy in view of his departure for Greece the following day. Having no communication tc make to the meeting himself, he asked Directors if they had anything to say.
2.	M. ÏT'ÎJTCUX said that since the last meeting
* *
he had attended a conference of the Union federale des Associations françaises de blessés, mutilés, reformés et anciens combattants. The meeting had shewn both remarkable confidence and interest in the work of the League and -an absence of illusion concerning it. IT.

S.	Al. MAHTCIK said that in the course of the Easter
holidays a complaint haa been presented by the Lithuanian Government concerning an alleged attack by Polish armed forces on a triage in the region of what one party called the ’’frontier” and the other "the line of demarcation” *
The Secretary-General had wired this complaint unofficially to Count Skrzynski for his information, and had said that he felt sure that the Council would expect the two Governments to take all possible measures to prevent an armed elash, Count Skrzynski had sent for the Secretary-General’s information a most formal denial that any attack had taken place, and complained of what he considered to be malicious accusations by the Lithuanian Government against Poland.
He informed the Secretary-General semi-officially that the Po’ish Government were considering an invitation to the Council to appoint a commission to define the frontier on the spot in accordance with the decision of the Conference of nzabassadcrs.
The Sec retary-General had, of course, kept in close though unofficial touch - ith the acting President of the Council, and consiaered that the incioent was closed, ms regards Count Skrzynski’s suggestion, it seemed to the Secretary-General that a delimitation of the frontier was a matter which concerned in the first instance the Conference of Ambassadors rather than the Council.
Sir Arthur SAL TEH, referring to the discussion of the last Lirectors’ Meeting, and particularly to the prophecy that no incident would take place over the Easter holidays, desired to point the moral that some governments were capable of disturbing the four days' rest of the Secretariat.
Lr. CÜ3I-ÏIUG3 added that a tier' or of the Information Section had stood by with instructions not to give any information.
4.
Captain MaTHLHLP
said that the Committee on the
Private Manufacture of .arms would meet next Monday in Paris to consider the Draft Convention.
5.	M. OPiuJSCU said that he had represented the Secretariat recently at the Conference of the British Association of Special Libraries. The Association had shown its desire to collaborate with the International Committee on Intellectual Co-operatirn.
6.	OPHESCU said that the International Committee on Intellectual Co-operation had convoked a meeting of representatives of International Students' Associations, with a. view to the avoidance of possible duplication of the work of these organisations and of the Committee.
After long negotiations with the .Deutsche 3tudentenschaft it had been arranged that a representative of that body-should attend the meeting in a consultative capacity.
7.	1£. HaaS said that he was going to London to attend a meeting of the International Shipping Conference. This was the first time that the Secretariat had been invited to a meeting oi that organisation, and he thought the collaboration which would be established thereby would be useful.
8.	Hr. GILCHRIST asked when the Committee on Free Distribution of Documents which ha ■ been set up was to meet.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that he thought the Committee to which Hr. Gilchrist rei’erred was to consider, at any rate principally, the sale of documents. It would meet when Professor Attolico convoked it.
Dame Rachel CROWDY complained of a recent case in which a ceitain number oi documents required by her Section had been printed, and that when the time came to
4
distribute the bulk oi them it had been found that they hau nearly all been sole by the Sales branch, This was inadnis sable, and she thought that the Sales Branch should inform the Section concerned that a given document would
prebab ly	sell, so	that more cop	ies could be	ordere d„	
Moreover,	the prin	ting of these	par ticular	documents	had
e xh aus te d	most of	the Section's	restricted	allowance	for
printing, but the Section's budget had not benefited by their wide sale. These were matter- which she hoped the G ommi t tee wo uId also c o ns i de r .
Sir Herbert H uS said that the question whether the result of sales tint bo used as rip worn iet ions in rid for sectional budgets had often been discussed. There were grave book-neeping difficulties in the way of such a procedure. However, he thought that if none hache 1 Crov/dy were to prepare for the Supervisory Commission a statement showing; that many oi the publications issued by her Section were sola, the Commission -mould show itself gererous in considering hex publications budget.
Ifr. CCLBAII observed that the documents required for official distribution b; the Section accounted for about nine-tenths of the cost of publication of a given set of documents including those sold. If the distribution of the refund from sales ~rere proportionate to the distribution of expenses, the lection would therefore gain very little. The essential point -vas, of course, that the Section should heve the documents which it wanted for
i
official distribution.
M. MpIcTCUX ^sked -whether there might not be a single publications but get for the --hole Secretariat.
Sir Herbert mH3 replied that the Assembly wished the estimates of the various Sections of the Secretariat to represent as completely as possible the expenses of the
work of the Sections. If there were a common budget for publications, there would be a demand for a common budget for other expenses which could be treated separately
Dr. R/'JCHIf'.IT and M. H 13 made certain complaints concerning the form in which documents were posted and distributed. Could not the Committee consider this matter too?
The DnPUTY-Si)CRbTAR Y-GEIJHRA.L thought that if these questions could not be arranged direct with the .Distribution Service they should be submitted to the Secretary-General.
lir. GILCHRIST hoped that the Committee would also ueal with free distribution of documents, which was connected with the question of sales.
The DLPUTY-SRCI HTaRY-GEIILRaI 3aid that the discussion would serve, in the first place, as a reminder that the Committee should meet; and, secondly, that the observations made at the meeting should be taken into account by the Committee*

I. The meeting considered the draft of the "genda of the Seventh Session ci the assembly which had been cir culated.
I ten 9. none Rachel CE017DY said that the year
1926 should be changed to 1925/1926, as the report was from J uly to J uly .
Item 11. The ._cting Secretary-General said that
this item should be .headed ”1 tern inserted by the assembly at
its Special Session of .'arch 1926.”
Item 12. On the proposal of Mr. Abraham it was agreed that the words "on the composition of the Council” should be i nser te d after the wo id ” C ommi t te e ” .
I ten 18. Dane Bache 1 CBC'VDY said that she ,T7o■aid give to Hr. Baxter* a revised wording of this item.
I ten 2C. On the proposal of Captain LCOUE it was decided that the report cf the Ccmnitiee on the Private Manufacture of 'ms should he inserted as a s ub - he ad ing o f this i ten.
Jane hache 1 CROV/iY ashed whether the report of' the Committee of enquiry into Opium Production in Persia should be added to the agenda as a sub-heading of Item 17. The cth Committee ox the assembly had expected that it mould receive this report at the forthcoming session.
Secondly, should there be an item relative to the Armenian Settlement Committee?
Tire Acting Secretary-General replied that it would be for the Council at its June Session to decide whether these items should be placed on the supplementary ■Agenda of the issembly.
Mr. GIUCHRIST reminded Directors that the Council, at its June Session, would also be called cn to decide whether the question of the silvery Convention should be submitted to a special conference or to the assembly; also that it had been the custom of the assembly at previous sessions tc place on its Agenda, on the motion of a aelegate, the work of the Permanent Mandates Commission.
In reply to Mr. McKinnon .Mod, Mr. BUZ TO II said that the agenda would be distributed to Members on cr about the 3rd of May.
II. Sir
attention of Direc ”Th i c h , in his op in
Herbert tors to a ion, rais
r n n
wished to draw the est submitted to him question of principle
o
A. member of the Secretariat, who nas go ins: to give certain lectures cn the League of nations in his own country, had ashed that any expenses which might he incurred through the engagement of a aaffic-lantern operator, the hire of a lecture h^ll, etc., should be r e fiinetd t c h i m.
Hitherto members of the Secretariat had received for work of this kina their travelling expenses and subsistence allowance. To grant the request of this official would be to establish an important precedent leading ultimate ly to the acceptance of the principle that members of the Secretariat should be encouraged to do propaganda for the League in their own countries on a considerable scale, and. that the League should bear the expenses incurred by this propaganda.	He did not
express any opinion on the point whether or not the time had arrived for this change of policy to be made, but he thought it right to point out that such a change of poliey would be implied in the granting of this specific request submitted to him.
F.	CGMEET did not think the implications of this specific request were as wide os Sir Herbert Ames had represented them to be. The case was that of Mr. Popovitch, who had arranged to give lectures in several of the smaller towns of the 3erb-Croat-3lovene kingdom in which organisations capable of bearing the necessary expenses were poor or non-existent. He hoped this case would be treated on its merits and not considered as establishing
a principle.
The mCTIHO SEC HD TjiRY-GEKBHAL thought that first necessary to consider the larger question of advisability of special leave being granted for mis
it was the
sions of
this kind, and, if there were precedents, to ascertain
4
exactly what they were, He therefore proposed that the question of principle raised by Sir Herbert Ames should be adjourned until the particu:ar case which he had mentioned had been discussed by Sir Herbert Anes, Gonert and himself.
III.	Captain LLOilL said that, of she two important letters recently received on the subject of the Preparatory Committee for the disarmament Conference, the letter from the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics would be communicated to all Members of the League ana the letter from the United States of America to the members of the Preparatory Committee only.
IV.	Captain LECHE said that, at the Committee
on the Private Manufacture of Arms now in session at Paris, M. Veverka had presented a first draft which called for the following comments:
1)	the uncertainty whether the Committee should report only on the private rwnu'^cture of arms or on the manufacture of arms in general, whether conducted by the State or privately, should be cleared up;
2)	the question of the appointment of an international office, which had been dismissed at the Conference on the traffic in arms, had reappeared;
c) the question ci possible investigations under the authority ox the league with reference to the manufacture of arms had also reappeared.
In reply to the ACHI7C- 3LCEHT.tRU-GLIERAL,
Captain LECITC said that the Committee would report to
the Council

I ).	The SEGRMJliRY-GBIMiRAL said that in the course
of his recent visit to Greece, where he and his colleagues hao been most courteously received, he had discussed with the Greek Authorities certain questions affecting, in particular, the work oi the Minorities and of the Transit Sections.
His general impression was that the intentions of the Greek Government under General Pangalos were peaceful and that a policy of adventure was improbable.
The refugee question was still acute and the Government wanted ° new loan. Phis could probably be obtained if the Government could satisfy the Financial Committee that the following conditions -vould be
realised: political stability, a balanced budget, good relations between the Government and the Greek Settlement Commission and abstinence from the purchase
of mini tic ns.
The prospects of politicel stability were perhaps better than they had been, as it was the intention of the rresident to restore, though within limits, constitutional government, Unfortunately, the non-settlament of refugees was itself one of the most important factors of instability.
Ly the use of certain rather abrupt measures the President hoped to balance the budget, Relations "between the Government and the Settlement Commission were not unsatisfactory, and it was stated that there was no intention to make any further purchases of muni ti ons.
The 3ECF.R TAHY-02I72B \L as fee cl Directors to send to the secretary of the era! ting Committee by ilonday, ' pri 1 26th, rny i teus proposed for the agenda of the June Session of the Council. The draft agenda
could thus be d i scussed at the nea.t uirectors ' lTeeting.
The 3xiC].^iThR Y-GLIILRaL asked Directors to be prepared to give iniomaticn when required to the Supervisory Commission at its meeting which would begin on holiday , .¡.pril 26th, and last probably till the Dr iday I o 1loving.
In reply to Dame RACELL CHOVDY, the SLCRLTARY-GUHLiRAl said that the Greek Government was doing its best to provide education for the refugee children.
The difficulty was school accommodation, and this was certainly as yet insufficient.
— o
Hr. COTE.MI gonfirmecl the pood intantions of the Creek Government end said thit «nother di^ficulty was that many of the refugee children spoke Turkish instead of Greek,

ii.fter some discussion, it was agreed that the meeting should, if possible, be public, and be opened b,y a speech bv tl:t. President (IL ADOE), the speech being read if, as seemed not unlikely, the President could not attend.
6) .	The SliCF.E TAEY-GEIER\L said that he proposed
to hold at the next Directors' Meeting a discussion on the question of the circulation of complaints made by one Member of the League against another Member, and asked Directors to pass the file on this sub feet quickly .
7) .	Sir Herbert AMDS asked Directors to pay heed
to, and if necessary take warning by, the statements of expenditure which had been issued concerning their respective Sections for the first quarter of the year.
8) ,	Dane HACfiuL CHO'/DY said that the Persian

In reply to Hr. COUBAE, the SLCRBTARY-GhlîLRAL g eve as an approximate estimate of the minimum curation oi the Committee on the Composition of the Council - ten days.
hr , iiorman V/HITE said that the Health Committee roula meet on monday, *ipril 26th, to be followed by a meeting of the Office International the following Honday.
The lECHKTASY-GJlEiRAL said that he had
✓
that morning been interviewed by the Charge d'Affaires o* the United states Legation at Berne, who had read to him a telegram from the State Department complaining that the Permanent Idvisory Committee and the Joint Committee seemed likely to play a more prominent part in the preparation of the Disarmament Conference than the United States c-ov°rnment had understood would be the case vrhen it had accepted the invitation to bo represented on the Preparatory Committee.
This communication, said the Secretary-General, had evidently been inspired by the fear that the preparation of the Conference would slip out of the hands of the Preparatory Committee into that of the Council. The Secretary-General had informed the United States Charge d'affaires that the Joint Committee and, for the purposes of the Disarmament Conference, the Permanent Advisory Committee, would be responsible to the Preparatory Committee only, which would bo complete master of
its own procedure

He himself had no doubt that there were certain iorces at worn impeding the collaboration of the United States Government with the league in the matter of uisarmamont, and he wished birectors to unuerstana what the situation actually was.
M. ULYL'Hli ashed if there was any foundation for the reports that the meeting of the Preparatory Comrai t tce wou 1 d be ad j our ne d .
The SEC STARY-GEUERAL said that he thought there was no foundation for these reports which, he believed, had originated with the diplomatic correspondent to the "Daily Telegraph” who, usually well-informed, and inventive when no information was to be had, was largely quoted in the Continental press
The SECRETLY-GEEURAL said that the United States Government had informed hi: that it did not intend to take part in the meeting of the Signatories of the Protocol ox the Permanent Court convoked for September 1st. The Lolgian Government had said that it would be represented at the meeting.

1* The Meeting considered the draft agenda of the 40th Session of the Council, which had been distributed (Annex), Various minor alterations were made in this draft agenda which MR. BUXTON was asked to embody in a revised agenda.
It was decided to amalgamate Items 1. and 2. under the heading "Budgetary and Administrative Questions".
Item gffi The SECRETARY-GETERAl explained that the Rapporteur would probably raise at the same ti'ic the question
ITT
The items are referred to under the numb-rs given in the draft agenda reproduced as an annex.
- 2 -
whether architects in the Saar and from Germany should also he allowed to compete. It was agreed that such action need not raise again the question of the admission of architects from the United States, The "moral admission" of Germany to the League last March, and the fact that the Assembly building would be used, also for conferences of the International Labour Organization of which Germany was a Member, seemed to justify the incLusicn of German architects.
Item 0. MB. MCKINNON WOOD was asked to redraft this item with MR. BUXTON.
Item 10, M. HAAS and MR. MCKINNON WOOL were asked to re-draft this item.
Item 11 (a). Subject to a final re-drafting by MR. GILCHRIST and MR. BUXTON this item was to read "questions relating to State domain, liquor traffic and military recruiting".
Items 7 (a) and (b) and 24 ( ->), It was pointed out that these items referred to the- same question.
MR. BUXTON was asked to submit, in consultation with the Legal and disarmament Sections, a new draft. Provisionally, Item 24 (a) should read "Arbitration and Security: Reports of the Sub-Committees of the Council on the Assembly Res©lutions", Item 7 disappearing.
Item 25( It was decided to delete the words "appointment of Preparatory Committees”.
Item 27. It was decided to delete this item.
It would be best that the British Representative should simply ask that the thanks of the Council should be addressed to MM. Jac and Markus.
3
With reference to I ten 12, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Council should decide whether the Delegates to the next Assembly should act at a Conference for the final establishment of the Slavery Convention or whether a conference should be held apart from the Assembly either immediately after it or, say, next spring. At present the last proposal seemed to him the best. If it was adopted the Assembly would have to make budgetaay provision»
Abe S E Cl IE TAR Y - 03 HER AL raised the question whether' the renewal of the mandates of the Presidents of the Committees of Enquiry set up under the scheme for the League's control of disarmament in certain countries in accordance with the Treaty Provisions should be placed on the agenda. These mandates had in fact expired last December, but it would be unfortunate if this question was now given any prominence.
The DEPUTY' SECTSTARY-GEULBAL thought that some member of the Council, at a private meeting, might state that the mandates of these presidents were considered as tacitly renewed.	It was agreed not to place the
question on the Agenda, and that the suggestion pu± forward by M. Avenol was probably the best method of procedure
2.	The SECRETARY-GEMJBA.L referred to the exchange of minutes which, had been circulated to Directors concerning the proposal made by IT. lieyman that the Council should rule that complaints by one Member of the League against another should be circulated to the Council or the Members of the League only if action by some organ of the League was re ques te d ,
4
The SECRETARY-GETTERAL said that he had at first sympathized with this suggestion. However, after considering the comments made by Directors, especially the arguments of the DEPUTY—SEC HE T.ARY-GLiluRjlL and if. HiiLfOUX, he was of opinion that the advantages of having such a rule would be outweighed by the disadvantage of the possible limitation of useful action in future cases, the enact nature cf which could not bo foreseen. He thought that on the whole that the Secretary-General should be free to treat each case on its merits.
Communications of the kind indicated by KEYMAIî might bo roughly divided into three classes:
1)	Those which called for action by some organ of the League in accordance with the Covenant, or a
Treaty. These, of course, the Secretary-General could not do otherwise than circulate.
2)	Commuai citions relevant to some question which was being considered by an organ of the League. These too should be circulated.
3)	Communications containing a general accusation by one lie mb or against another, but not formally asking
for action under the Covenant or a Treaty, and net strictly relevant to thu current business of on organ of the League. These, whenever possible, should first be communicated to the accused Government for its observations and then sent privately before any official communication was made, to the Mentors of the Council.
In important and urgent cases it might be desirable immediately to inform the Members of the Council privately of the original communication.
5
There was a fourth class:	Comrrani cat ions
sent for the information of the Scoretary-Goneral.
As to those ho considered the Score tor,/'-Gonor al should keep a completely free hand.
It would be very difficult for the Council to lay down a satisfactory rule governing the action in all future possible cases, and if such a rule were laid down the Secretar^-General would have endless discussions with Governments concerning its application in particular cases.
TJic Secretary-General added that accusations under category 3 had hitherto been made only by Lithuania and Albania against more powerful Members of the League. The fact that this kind of communication had been so rare enhanced the arguments against laying down at present a general rule.
MR. COLB al agreed that it would be premature to ask the Council for a decision. However, he thought that on the receipt of communications of the third category the Secretary-General might often think it right to use non-official action, which might lead to a withdrawal of the accusation. nor instance, if an important Government charged another important Government, the Secretary-General would be justified, before circulation, in drawing the accusing Government1s attention to the fact that no formal action under the Covenant or Treaty was requested.
The SIjCRETAEY-GEHERAL said that he intended of course to continue the use of non-official action in the sense suggested by M. Colban.
6
The DEPUTY SECHE TAR Y-GEIÏER AL agreed with the views of the Secretary-General. Important Governments had little occasion to use the machinery of the League for communications of the third class as they had diplomatic and other means at their disposal for making complaints which did not involve formal action by the League. On the other hand, small States without sufficient diplomatic representation might feel a measure of protection in using the machinery of the League thus to make their fears known. To meet cases of this kind, he thought the Secretary-General's discretion should be left intact.
M. MAIJTOUX thought that when accusations of a specific character were made there was a presumption in favour of communication, but there was a presumption against it in the case of general accusations.
The SECRET'IRY-GEIJERAL observed that there was general agreement that the Council should not be asked to lay down a rule.
3.	The 3ECRET/\RY-GERERA.L said th^t the action of the Supervisory Commission with regard to the budget for 1927 was causing some dissatisfaction. The point of view of the Commission was that the budget was always drawn up by the Secretariat on the assumption that all the work proposed by the assembly would be carried out in its entirety, whereas in fact it baa never been possible so to carry it out, and there had consequently been a considerable surplus each year. It had therefore made a suggestion, which he hinself thought not altogether unreasonable, that while making only slight reductions on the detailed estimates of the Secretariat, it should say that since a surplus of, say, a million might be expected at the end of the financial year, the total budget might be reduced by, say, half a
milli.on.
7
SIR HERBERT .ESS said that the; Supervisory Commission was wrong in assuming that surpluses in future years would he as great as in the past. There had been special reasons, which would not recur, ler those large surpluses.
What the members of the League really cared about was that their individual contributions for a given year should not be sensibly greater than for the previous year. Why, therefore, should not the Supervisory Commission recommend that a certain part of the surplus for the past year should be applied to the reduction of the now budget, so that it could be brought derm to the total figure 0f of the past year?
Moreover, it should be remembered that only about 92fc of the money was received.
The 3ECRETLRY-CEIISRLL said that the last was an important point which had not been sufficiently emphasized before the Commission.
The DEPUTY SE C RE TfRv-GEHERAL thought that there was some confusion in the use of th~ torm"surplus”.
The Supervisory Commission was not thinking of the surplus which had accrued through, for instance, the payment within a given year of large arrears of contributions, but rather of the surplus due to the non-performance of certain work which had been budgeted for in a given year.
PROrij3LGR -^TTGLICO thought that much trouble would be avoided if the budget were presented differently bj the Secretariat.	He proposed that each chapter of tho budget
should consist of a consolidated part and a special part.
In the first part should ho included estimates of current expenses. Those could be fairly exactly drawn up and their margin of error need not oxc od, say, 2g. In the special
8
psrt should he included items such as Conferreces, under which expenditure was uncertain, -'nd did not depend on action by the Secretariat. On this part the surplus night vary greatly as it night or night not be found possible in agiven year to hold the Conferences or perfora the other work budgeted for. By this means the Secretariat would bo rid of the imputation, which it now unjustly suffered, of over-budge ting.
This improved presentation would also strengthen the hands of the Secretary-General in refusing to discuss with the Commission administrative questions which were not its concern; for instance, whether a clerk asked for should be of the local or international class. It would also force the Supervisory Commission to face its responsibilities squarely. At present it did not satisfy its desire for reduction by proposing a cut on the Disarmament Conference, for instance, but by reducing estimates for the essential services of the Secretariat.
If the budget were drawn up in the way he proposed a total reduction of ’ xT per cent on the second or "uncertain" part of the budget could be made by the Commission.
M. MaBTOUX thought that there should be a general item for, say, "Conferences" for the whole Secretariat rather than separate estimates in each chapter.
The SdCRETARY-GEHJRAL did not agree.
M. HAAS said that the Supervisory Commission first formed an idea of the total which it thought tolerable, next it ascertained whether the detailed estimates were justified. If the total of the estimates thus found correct still exceeded the tolerable total, would it not be better that the Secretary-General should be asked to
9
propose the necessary reductions rather than that the Commission should take it on itself to reduce item by itme? It could not be expected to understand the minor necessities of the ndministration.
ME. COLBAIT did not quite agree. He thought that the Commission should from time to time examine thoroughly a small point; for instance, for what reasons a stenographer was asked for in a given Section.
Generally he approved of Professor .ittolicors division between the current and uncertain expenditure.
The SECHE TAR Y-GSHERAL said that the expenditure was rwally of three kinds
1)	Fixed current expenditure, salaries, etc.
2)	Elastic current expenditure; ^or instance, annual Meetings of Committees, the expenses of which varied within certain limits.
3)	Extraordinary expenditure, such as special Conferences, which was practically the same as expenditure other than annual expenditure.
He thought that in future Professor Attolicors suggestion might be acted on. Of course if the expenses for a given year exceeded the estimates as reduced by the commission the deficit would be met out of the working capital fund, and added to the budget of the following year.
The DEPUTY SECRETAHY-GEUERAL added that the Assembly in approving the Budget, should undertake to repay to Working capital any such advances.
In reply to SIR HERBERT AMES, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the division of the estimates suggested by Professor Attolico should be made under each chapter and not over the budget as a whole.
10 -
4.	The SECHL imRY-GEIffiR ,iL said that it was time for the Secretariat to consider its responsibility in regard to the protection of delegates at Council Meetings. His own feeling was that unauthorised individuals were much t&Q freely admitted to the Secretariat building.
It was true that the Council decided at short notice to hold public Meetings, and that there might be some difficulty in arranging for the rapid distribution of cards of admission, but nevertheless, it was desirable that this difficulty should be overcome if possible and the general public be admitted only with cards.
The DEPUTY UECHETfRY-GEPERIL agreed. The fact that a Meeting of the Council was public did not imply indiscriminate admission. There- was need for a more vigorous surveillance of the Council room and the whole Secretariat building.
Mr. COXuiiili said that a preliminary difficulty was that the Establishment Office, where the cards were distributed, was on the second floor. What was wanted was a scrutiny of the requests for admission at the Secretariat entrance itself.
The 3ECRETARY-GEIERaI asked PROFESSOR ATTOLICO to examine the: whole question thoroughly and to arrange with I’T?, FT TJS TO IT. in consultation perhaps with Mr. Pelt, for the necessary action to be taken.
5.	PROCESSOR ATTOLICO asked whether there had been any systematic examination in the Secretariat cf the terms of the Russo-Garman ¡.treaty.
The 3 Ei C PE T \R v -GEIERAL saic that this had net yet
been done.	He	h i	rise 1 f w ss not a 1m me d	by the ter	ms of this
Treaty.	3 oae	of	them were capable of	d if fe rent	inter-
pretations, but he saw in them nothing which was necessarily incompatible with the covenant. Everything depended on
11
their applicaticn. fron the Loague-7s point of vie-w the conclusion of the Treaty it the present moment did not seen very opportune, but if a similar Treaty had been made between two members of the league, it would probably have been thought a natter for congratulation.	He
understood that the Treaty had be on drawn up some months ago, and of course its publication at the present tine was partly designed to warn those Governments who desired Germany1 s entry to the League.
The DEPUTY 3BOSSTARY-G3HEB\L thought that the Treaty expressed clumsily an intention which was in fact loyal. The result was that it appeared suspicious.
PPOTES30H iTTOLIOO agreed that there was nothing disloyal in the Treaty, but he- doubted whether the spirit in which it had been drawn up was of the best.
G.	1$. KCEIlinOiT '70OD said that ~11 the States invited to be represented on the Committoe on the composition of the Council had named their representatives except Brazil',. Poland and Uruguay.
PhOilSSOH nTTOLICO said that he had heard in Heme that in th.. course of Sir William Tyrrell's recent visit there a suggestion had been made that the jurists of the four principil no car no Powers should meet before the Session of the Commitceo. He had first been favourably impressed with this id o -, but had later concluded that this was not a matter :• or jurists.
There was a general agreement by the Meeting with the latter view, and that the loss separate consultation of the Locarno Powers at the Commission the bettor.

The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL. Professor ATTOLICO.
Dr. IJITOBE,
Sir Herbert AMES.
3 ir Ar thur SALTER.
Mr. COMBAN.

Mr. CUMMINGS.
Mr. GILCHRIST.
Mr. BERG.
Mr. WILSON. Secretary.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL. referring to the consideration by the last meeting of' the manner of' preparing the budget of the Secretariat, said that the Supervisory Commission with which the whole question had been discussed had not made any formal recommendation relative thereto'. The Secretariat, therefore, had time to consider whether it was possible to present the estimates for the budget for the following year under two categories for each Section, as suggested at the last meeting,
The Supervisory Commission had reduced the estimates of the Secretariat for 1927 by some 600,000 francs, of which sum 150,000 francs concerned conference and Assembly estimates.
He did not believe that on the whole the work of Sections would be damaged by the reductions, though he confessed to a certain apprehension as regards the Section of International Bureaux, which might be unable to carry out a revision of the Handbook of International organisations which had teen intended; and the
publication of an English edition of the Handbook. However, this was the kind of work for which outside help might be offered to and accepted by the Council.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that all Sections should take watning of the fact that the Supervisory Commission was scrutinising more and more carefully the two items of Printing and Overtime, and intended to propose to the Assembly the adoption of a resolution tending to limit the number and size of.the League’s publicationSe
The SLCEnTAKY-GHKSRAL said that the idea of the Supervisory Commission was that, of the two categories cf League publications - the essential and the merely desirable -the latter might bo reduced.
Sir Arthur SALTAH agreed with Professor Attolico that it was net necessary always tu print the llinutos of commissions.
It would often suffice if a resume of their decisions was printed. He hoped, however, that the reductions would net be* carried to the extent of abolishing that kind of printing which was the result of much preparatory work and of which the cost was only a small part of the total cost of such work, for instance, the statistical work done by Hr. Loveday and his staff.
Professor ATTOLICO felt sure that the economy would not be pushed to such an extreme. To print resumes instead of full llinutos of committees would be a most important saving, and by doing so the Secretariat would go far to meet the wishes of the Commission,
Hr. HAAS observed that the summoned by a government wore always 'than League records. He did not t gulf should exist between the two.
records of any conference? more sumptuously printed hink that an infinitely wide
The Deputy SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the Secretariat should make, preferably through a committee, a thorough and comprehensive study of the whole question of league publications, their relative importance, their selling value, and all cognate questions.. There would thus be less chance of arbitrary reductions being made-
Mr, MADARIAGA said that it should bo more widely realised that the Secretariat was not all-powerful in the matter of publication, Commissions sometimes insisted, in the face of representations from the Secretariat, on printed full records of their proceedings..
Sir Arthur SALTER agreed that it should be more clearly known just where the responsibility lay for publication.
Sir Herbert AMDS thought that secretaries should show more courage in informing commissions, when necessary, that there was not an appropriation for printing on the scale which the commission desired.
Mr. MAIAEIAGA said that to do this the Secretariat should be strengthened by a definite ruling by the Assembly„
Professor ATTGLICO agreed and said that this would probably be done.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the committees of which the Social and Opium Section furnished the Secretariat, and also the Permanent Mandates Commission, were rather extravagant as regards the printing of their minutes. He agreed with the Deputy Secret ary-'C-enera^s proposal for a committee, and asked him, in consultation with Professor Attelioo, to appoint a committee of not exceeding, say, 5 members, of which Mr. Pelt might bo asked to act as secretary and also as liaison officer with the Committee on the Sale of Publications which had been set up.
-4-
Professor ATI’Old CO asked that oa oh Section should start by thinking the subject over and considering what constructive proposals could be made,
8. Sir Herbert A..12S thought that directors should realise that transfers in the Secretariat budget, both internal transfers and those authorised by the Council, were closely examined by the Supervisory Commission which required a convincing defence from the Secretary-General for each of them
m-u
e DEPUTY SECREILiRY-GELEEAli thought that it was a question
ox degree. Obviously, the Secretariat would to blameworthy if transfers affecting all sections were made, but with closely prepared estimates a certain number of transfers were inevitable.,
The SECREIltiRY-GSRERaL agreed that the alternative to the possibility of transfers was a budget drawn up with a largo margin
of expenditure in each chapter. He did not think that the Supervisory Commission had felt very critical of tho transfers
made, except that they had been excessive in the Health Scotion.
•3. The SECRETARY-GBllEPa-L said that the Legal Section, assisted by a member of the Political Section, would provide the Seoretaria for the Committee on the Composition of the Council which was to meet on tho 10th May. He himself hoped to follow its discussions throughout,
It has been suggested that there should be a Secretariat Committoe to study the question and to hold its expert knowledge et the d .sposal of the Committee. While agreeing that members of tho Secretariat competent to do so should study this question, he thought it essential to avoid any appearance that the Secretariat Was trying to direct the Committee, and he therefore c'id not propos
-5-
tc appoint o Secretariat Committee. Ho would oortuinly consult various members of tho Secretariat as arid when occasion arose.
Jr. OU i/MI Is Go asked if any ccmmuniqud could be made to tho press on the Committee's discussions.
The SECEElliRY-GEIvERuIi said that this would rest with the Committee. It would probably moot in private and very likely not issue any oommuniqui at first, but it would certainly wish to do so when any decision of importance was taken.
Various suggest ions having been mad.' concerning tho means by which the members of the Secretariat should be enabled to know the proceedings of the Committee, tho Secretary-General said he preferred net to appr vo .f any definite plan with this object; but he would see what c.uld Lo done when tho time came,
id, LinlnEItiGn asked if there was any indication who would
presid e.
The SECRETARY-GEEERsL said that, of course, tho Committee itself would decide, but the most natural solution seemed to bin to be that the representative of tho meting President of the Council should preside. He recalled that it has been suggested in the "Journal do Genbve" that Id. Llotta should do so. Ho did not know the authority for this supposition,
M, COLnuiii did not think the last would bo a good solution: the impression should net gain ground that tho League of Rations was "in Switzerland" otherwise than in a strictly spatial sonfio.
4.	Sir Herbert i-YES asked how momoers of the Secretariat could assist in awakening interest in their own countries in tho competition for the new building.
Professor jPl'TQLICO thought that the Information Section, together with other members cf the Secretariat who ware in especially close touch with their own countries, should see to it that artioles on the competition were published in the press. The professional associations of architects would also he informed of tho competition«, Individual members of the jury might also help to make it known,
Sir Herbert AMES askod. that this question might be discussed at a later Directors’ Meeting,
In reply to Sir Arthur baiter, Professor iiTTO.UCO said that
the programme of the competition left it open whether there should be one building for the Assembly Hall end Secretariat or two, but
that it had been pointed out that tho Secretariat must bo provided with undisturbed accommodation,
5,	Mr, GILCHRIST, referring to the statement made at the last Directors’ Meeting that the United States would probably be interested in the proposed Slavery Conference, said that a letter from the State Department’ has just been received acknowledging receipt of the Secretary-General's letter asking for observations on the Draft Convention, but sending nono»	Prom this it might
be gathered, though it did not necessarily follow, that tho Unites States Government would not be represented at tho Conference ,■
The SECRETARY-GEHERaI thought that if this ware known in the United States, various bodies cf opinion might express themselves in favour of representation. He proposed that, after the usual 48 hours notice tc the legation at Dorno, the letter to the State Department should be published.
-7-
6.	Sir Arthur SjJ/fER said that the meeting of the Broparatory Committee for the Economic Conference had in his opinion boon fairly successful, thanks largely tc the admirable chairmanship of i. l'heunis. It vías interesting that an obviously inspired article in the "Kft’nischer Zeitung" had declared that a more truly international feeling had prevailed at that Commission than at other League conferences and Committees.
7.	Sir nrthur SnLl'ER said that Bulgaria had applied to the League for assistance in the settlement of refugees. The sutjoct had been placed on the agenda of the next Counoil session.
The oECEETiiRY-G-EEE RAL suggested that about the 8th May a short oomm.uniq.u6 might be issued, stating that this application had been roaeived and had been plaoed on the Counoil agenda.
8.	Sir nrthur SALTER said that tho trial of the Hungarian note forgers, in spite of rumours to the effect that it would not take place, was to begin on May 7th.
9.	Sir Herbert AMES, referring to a conversation he had had with Mr. Howland, said that the Greek Refugees Settlement Commission was engaged in the publication of a book presenting in a readable manner, with illustrations, the story of the settlement of Greek Refugees» He thought that other successful works of the League might to presented to the public in the same way.

le SECRETAIRE GENERAI déclare que les résultats des travaux de la Commission pour la réforme du Conseil ont été très satisfaisants. la question des membres permanents n1 avait pas été abordée mais on a trouvé un accord en ce qui concerne selle des membres non permanents, ce qui sera accueilli avec satisfaction par lrAssemblée. La Commission devra se réunir une seconde fois le 28 Juin sur convocation de son Président.
2. Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL exprime sa satisfaction pour les résultats atteints par la Commission Préparatoire du Désarmement. L1impression général® est très favorable, On a fait ressortir que o1 est la première fois que les questions du désarmement sont abordées avec un esprit vraiment pratique. Parmi les questions principales oui sont encore à résoudre il y a encore colle concornant les mesures économiques
2
et financières â prendre en vertu de lTart. 16 du Pacte. Oette question est transmise au Conseil nui la renverra à son tour au Comité du Conseil. Il serait -très désirable que l'Allemagne plit prendre part à ce Comité.
M„ MADARIAGA oommunique quril lui résulte que 1 Allemagne aimerait à être invitée à faire partie du Comité du Conseil.
le SECRETAIRE GENERAL continue son exposé et ajoute que le Comité du Conseil renverra certaines questions d1 ordre économique, financier et concernant le B«I,T. à l'étude de la Commission Mixte.
M. DENIS attire l'attention sur la difficulté qu'il y aurait a réunir deux fois la Commission Mixte dans l'espace de deux ou trois mois; premièrement pour étudier les questions qui lui ont été transmises par la Commission Préparatoire du Désarmement, deuxièmement pour celles que le Comité du Conseil lui renverra.
Après une longue discussion il a été décidé de fixer la date de réunion de la Commission Mixte au 1er. Juillet. Le Comité du Conseil pourrait à son tour se réunir vers le 25 Juin.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL est d'avis que pour ce qui concerne la question budgétaire il serait opportun d’avoir auparavant une étude préliminaire préparée par le Secrétariat. Puisqu'il se rencontre que la Section Economique et Financière est surchargée de travail pour la préparation de la Conférence Economique, il pense que l'on pourra.it s'assurer la collaboration d'un personnel temporaire en attribuant la dépense aux fonds de la Conférence du Désarmement,

3.	Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL communique qu'il a eu oes jours passés des entrevues avec plusieurs personnalités venues à Genève entre autres aveo M. Nintchich et M. Bouroff*
Il s^est Pendu compte pue pour ce qui concerne l'emprunt bulgare pour les réfugiés il existe quelques malentendus. Bien quron prétende que drun point de vue technique et juridique la Grèce et le Royaume de 3.H.S. ne soient pas intéressés dans
la question ils manifestent quelque méfiance au sujet de la politique du Gouvernement bulgare, et au point de vue pratique cette atmosphère difficile pourrait entraver d'une façon considérable la solution de la question. Toutefois, il est convaincu qu'elle est due au moins en partie à des malentendus et qu'une discussion discrète entre les Ministres responsables pourrait avoir pour effet d'améliorer sensiblement les relations entre les pays en question.
M. DENIS observe qu’il serait opportun que M* Nintchich soit présent pendant la discussion de la question à la prochaine session du Conseil.
4.	DENIS fait observer que le rapport sur les travaux du Comité préparatoire de la Conférence Economique devrait être présenté d'abord au Conseil siégeant en Comité.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL répond qu'il nTest pas nécessaire i'annoncer d'avance la réunion de ce Comité, qui aura lieu pendant la réunion du Conseil, de la même façon aue celles des autres Comités e.g. le Comité hongrois etc.
M. DENIS attire l'attention sur le fait que les membres de la Commission préparatoire ont envisagé le commencement d'cctobre comme date probable de réunion pour la reprise
des travaux. Il est douteux que la réunion puisse avoir lieu à cette date étant donné que tout le mois de Septembre est occupé par les travaux de l’Assemblée et que le travail préparatoire pour la réunion demande un certain temps. Il croit que la date la plus proche pourrait être la fin d’octobre.
Il est entendu que MM. Madariaga et Eenis se mettront d1accord entre eux.
5.	Mo HAAS se référant aux débats de la Conférence des passeports se déclare très satisfait des résultats obtenus. Plusieurs des voeux émis seront certainement mis en vigueur*, Certaines questions de détail ont été réglées, comme par exemple celle des visas. Enfin il a été orée un esprit d'entente qui ne manquera pas de donner les meilleurs résultats.
le SECRETAIRE GENERAL observe ou1il a quelquefois entendu soulever la ouestion de savoir s'il convient de procéder à de nouveaux accords internationaux, du moment que l'on rencontre des difficultés considérables a obtenir la ratification des accords précédents.
M. HAAS remarque que pour oe qui concerne la ratification des accords internationaux concernant sa Section la situation est satisfaisante. En particulier la Convention du Transit a été déjà ratifiée par tous les Pays européens, celle pour le regime des eaux navigables par la plus grande partie d'entre eux. Il nTy a pas de doute qu'il en sera de même pour la Convention des voies ferrées.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL pense qu’il serait bien de profiter du séjour des fonctionnaires dans las ratifications nécessaires.

M. LENTS attire l'attention sur 1ropportun!té qu'il y aurait dans certains cas de donner la préférence à des accords "bilatéraux plutôt qu'a des conventions générales. Naturellement ces accords particuliers devraient être stipulés en se "basant sur les mêmes lignes directrices afin de faciliter la création d'une situation juridique uniforme.
6.	Sir HERBERT AMES informe que le montant des contributions reçues la semaine passée est de 1-1fZ million de francs suisses.
Il s'attend à ce que le total des contributions reçues pendant les cinq premiers mois de 1926 soit égal à celui de 1925 pour la même période.
Pour ce qui concerne le nouveau bâtiment les plans, les photographies et les autres annexes seront envoyés de façon qu'ils puissent parvenir aux différents Etats membres le 25 Juillet. A propos du bâtiment le SECRETAIRE GENERAL fait allusion à la possibilité de tenir les réunions de l'Assemblée au Bâtiment Electoral, cependant il a des doutes surtout à cause de la mauvaise acoustique.

Mr. WILSON (Secretary)
I. The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the 40th Session of
the Con-noil was probably the shortest on record though its agenda had been heavy. Ho drew tho practical conclusion that v/honover possible the afternoon following the morning on whioh the Counoil adopted its agenda and also the morning of the following day should be free from plenary meetings of the Council so as to be available for Council Committee meetings on Minority and other questions. If Counoil Committees sat in this interval reports for rapporteurs could bo prepared oaxly} adjournments oould be avoided and the whole proceedings greatly facilitated.
Sir Arthur SALÆBR said that the completion of tho session in four days had placed a very heavy strain on the staff. In
principle thu Council shsuld bo prepared to sit for a week.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agroed. VJhat he insisted on was that there Ehould be a fairly long interval with no plenary meetings early in the session,
M. CHMERT having observed that it was bad for the Press to have nothing tc report for a long period in the course of the Counoil session, it was agreed that, provided there was a plenary meeting each day, which was possible under the arrangement outlined by the Secretary-General, no great harm would be done to the interests Of the Press.
II.	After some discussion it was agreed that on or about the 21st June steps should be taken to oonsult the Acting President Of the Council and the President of the Committee on the
Composition of the Ccunail concerning the advisability of postponing the meeting of that Committee at present fixed for the
¡20th June.
III.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that after disoussion with Professor Attolioo, M, Ccmort and Mr. Huston, he had decided that the next session of the Assembly should be held in the Salle de
*
la Reformation and net in the Batiment Electoral. It had been agreed that it would cost too much to fit up the Batiment Elect oral for tho Assembly,
IV.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL raised tho question of the distribution by tho Secretariat of nctos by members of League Committees containing matter offensive to some Member of the Loaguo. His
own view wa3 that if the member of tho Committee concerned insisted the Secretariat oeuld not finally refuse, tut in most oases the authors of these memoranda would withdraw them if the unpleasant oonsequenoea which might follow their oiroulatiCn were made clear.
He askod «secretaries of committees, if asked to oiroulato such memoranda in future and if the authors insisted, to oonsult him.
-3-
Prcfossor ATTCLICO thought it important that a member of a committee insisting on circulation should bo required to state this precisely in writing and should also say whether he ashed for circulation on the authority of his Gore mment.
Mr. OGLBAH thought it an important natter ol principle that the accused Government should he given an opportunity of making its observations before the memorandum was circulated, and secretaries should make this clear to the authors of
invidious memoranda.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GE2JERAL suggested that the secretaries of tho committees could act on the proposals of Professor Attolioo and Mr., Colban both. They could both ash if a memorandum was being circulated on the authority of the author1s Government and could inform the author that it would bo sent to tho acoused Government for observations.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that in many cases it would bo difficult for the secretary to ash the author if he had his Governments authority. as a last rosort tho Secretariat might
refuse to circulate, suggesting to the author that ho should circulate the memorandum himself to the members of tho committee. The DEPUTY SECRETARY--GENERAL observed that statements made
by a member of a toohnical committee} even though derogatory tc some Member of the League, should not be given the weight of
similar statements mado, for instance, before the Council or any other political body. It was in the interests of the working of tho League that greater liberty should be given to speakers on oemmittees. It was a question of degree whether observations disagroeablo to Governments should be tolerated,
V.

.Jhe SECITTAMY-CiGII! FAL die1, net rich the discussion to lead to an7 very far-reaching conclusions. Ho thought that repxesenta-tion by secretaries of committees or, in eases where that failed, reference to hinsolf, would save serious trouble in most eases.
The uHCHETA 5Er-Gr.ITPAL summarised the correspondence which, had taken place with the "Ere lieu voile" the representative ox which had assaulted Count Both Ion on the premisos ox the Secretariat on the 10th June. It was proposed to send a final letter to that paper, stating that its representatives would "be
excluded from attendance at League meetings but without stating for how long. Perhaps the question could be reopened just
before the Ansenbly.
Professor ATT07IC0 thought the main question was to ascertain whether or net the paper was responsible in this case for tho action of its represent‘.tire • This might emerge from the enquiry into the case by tho Swiss Federal authorities*
The DEPUTY SECFETAET-iTIFLAL thought that if it appeared that the paper had accredited its representative knowing him to be hostile to Count Bethlen and capable of intending to assault him its privileges should be definitely withdrawn, but if it had boon guilty of nothing worse than negligence it would be best, as Professor Attolico had suggested, to wait for furthor infornjs.tion. Ho further proposed that a letter might be sent to papers which wero not represented at Groncvs by members of the Association of Journalists accredited to the league, pointing out that as tho Lv/iss Police Authorities could not act on tho promises of the League, it should be a point of honour for journalists to behave
corro ct ly.
Mr* McMIFIIOF l/GQD doubted the wisdom of sending such a letter as he was not certain of the validity of the legal
argument underlying it
-5-
The SSCREl'ARY-GSNERAL oonoludod that, at any rato, the 1 lot tor whioh he proposed to send to the "Ere Kou Velio1', withholding its right to "bo roprosonted at tho League mootings hut not raising the question when and how this right might ho restored, should ho sent.. A oiroular might ho drafted as suggested by M. Avonol but on more general linos, Ho proposed that II. Comort should prepare this,
YI.	Professor ATIOLICO romindod tho mooting that tho President
of the Association of Journalists had posted in the Pross Room a copy of a letter whioh he had sent to Lord Ceoil,. oomplimenting him on his insistence on tho meetings of the Commiutee on tho Composition of tho Council hoing held in public and rofheating unfavourably on the contrary attitude alleged to have bion taken up by Signor Soialoja.
In faot, the attitude of Signor Soialoja had been misrepresented and with M. Comert^ help tho question had Ixoen quickly and smoothly settled, It was therefore a clocol incident, but tho question cf prinoiplo remained to bo considered whether in tho Pross Room notices oritioising tho ¡action of Members of the Council or their representatives should bo posted.
In reply to the Sucretary-Goneral, M. COMERS! explained that, the existing practieo was that notioos of meetings, group luncheons,
etc,, wore posted in tho Pross Room, He agreed that tho room should not bo used for political critioism of any kind, but he did
not wish to be placed under tho necessity of writing officially to Journalists bringing this to their notioo. At present they felt at homo in tho Press Room, and if they received suoh a letter they
-6-
would have the impression in future that they were being supervised. Ho was confident that by personal action on his part a repetition of disagreeable incidents of this kind could be avoided.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL was satisfied if M. Comert could give him this assurance. His own opinion was that not only notices of a political nature but also offensive caricatures
should not be tolerated on the notice boards in the Press Room.
VII. The SECRETjiRY~GEHERAL said that he had no information beyond
what had appeared in the press concerning the Brasilian situation.
M, de MADARIAGA, asked to give his views concerning the Spanish situation said that, in his opinion the interpretation to be put to the present attitude of the Spanish Government was that nothing irreparable would be said or done in Madrid, as long as nothing irreparable was not said in Geneva, and he urged that neither the Committee on the Composition of the Council, nor the Council, nor the Assembly would take any decisions which might be considered by Spain as finally and for over deoiding the question of permanent seats or as prejudging it in a final way» He believed that seme action should be taken on these lines in order to prevent any irreparable harm being done, particularly at the ooming Assembly.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that as the Committee on tho
Composition of the Council had a definite instruction to consider the claims of individual countries, it could not pass the question of tho permanent seats over in silonco. It might, however, decide that it was best to postpone consideration of these claims.
M. do MADARIAGA 3aid that there was a bare possibility of postponing the crisis so far as Spain was concerned by taking
-7-
stops to assure Spain that between the Assemblies of 1926 and 1927 the specific case of Spain, namely the question of knowing whether Spain would, cr would not obtain a seat in the Council, irrespective cf any questions of principle or of any othor candidatures, would be considered and decided.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL end the DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL both thought that it would be dangerous for individual members of the Council to onoourage Spain by such assurances, as this might lead to misunderstandings similar to those which arose at the March session cf the Counoil.
M. da MADARIAGA said that in his opinion the solution proposed by the Committoe on the Composition of the Counoil could not meet with Spanish approval for it did not appeal to Spoin as being a conciliatory proposal at all. This solution did not give Spain re-eligibility. It merely re-opened every three years the question of the Spanish accession to the Council. The Committee seem to have forgetton that Spain entered the League with an article 4 which, as long as it was not touched, guaranteed Spain an indefinite re-election* Spain found the yearly re-election on a simple majority tiresome and asked for a permanent seat. As a conciliatory proposal she was now offered her re-election by a two-third majority. This could hardly he considered as satisfactory. Perhaps two alternative solutions on this question might have boon studied; one, to declare once for all, either on a proposal of the Council, approved by tho Assembly, or by a special vote of tho Assembly, that such and such a country would be re-eligible. This, it should be noted, would not bind tho Assembly tU elect such countries and therefore, the freedom cf the Assembly remained intact; the second to declare that of the elected Members a given number, say, one third, would be re-eligible.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL thought the question of the twe-thirds majority of little importance. Practically all the
G
members elected to the Cornell hc.d had c. two-thirds majority.
He saw great di fficuIt ies in cle x^adariaga1 s proposal.
If the principle of non re-eligibility were accepted a nicer tain members specifically exempted from the operation of this principle, the Assembly would be dissatisfied.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that there was much to be said for the idea of leaving it to the Assembly to reelect certain specially named States up to a given number,
I-r. COLBA.N liked the reoemntendations of the Committee on the Composition of the Council, even the proposal concerning the two-thirds majority. It would not be hard to got this majority for any State which it was really desirable to retain on the Council. If only a simple majority was required for re-election, there would be a tendency for the Assembly to form itsolf into two opposing groups, each hopeful of commanding the simple majority for their respective candidates. The provision for the two-thirds majority would mean that in this matter the assembly would have to act as a whole and the result would not constitute the victory of cne group over another.
x.-. de IxADAHIAGA said that the proposals Of the Committee could be considered under two aspects: 1) as proposals for the reform of the Council; 2) as conciliatory proposals for the solution of the immediate crisis.
The Deputy Secretary-General had not, xhe thought, done justice to his objections. The question of fact could hardly be used to conciliate Spain for, while it was truo that Spain had been elected all these years, it was precisely the waste ox energy caused by this continuous re-electiOn which had led Spain to ask 'a permanent seat. In the opinion Of the present Spanish Cover men t, Spain could only be a useful —.ember
-9-
of	the	Counoil		if	she ’	VOS	indooend	Gilt of	election
consid		era	tions	in	11}»	And	if she	coul d .	not be an independent
Her.	rber	of	the	Cou n	oil,	a nd	therefore, if		she could not have
a seat in the Council, she did not foci that her cooperation with the league of nations could he useful, either to the League of Rations, or to her.	— oreover, it should be
realized that the amendment of Article 4 of the Covenant acted against Spain and against Spain alone in fact, though of course, not in the intention of the people who had urged its amendment.
The SECRETARY-CRN TRA1 said that it 'was clear, first that the Assembly had been to an overwhelming degree in favour of some, system of rouloment; second that it would not agree to the creation of another privileged class of members after the permanent members. The recommendation of the Committee by which, after a year, the Assembly would decide which of the elected members would bo considered re-eligible, was a compromise between the suggestion that the Assembly when first electing 9 members should declare 3 of them by name to be re-eligible, and the proposal, that no members should be re-eligible at all. If the two principles (l) of rouloment and (2). that no special class of 11 ambers apart from the Permanent members should be created were'assured he felt sure that any proposals which Spain oould agree to would receive the Committee's most favourable consideration.
The question of the simple cr the two-thirds majority seemed to him of quite minor importance.
Professor ATTOIICO was personally in favour of retaining the present system. He doubted whether the assembly curod as much for a system of roulenent as had been supposed,
-10-
The Deputy SECRETARY-GEILS^L agreed with the Secretary-General that a grec t majority of the mssenbly desired a system of roulement, hut as it had also wished to keep Spain on the Council it had done violence to its own wishes by continuing to cleot Spains
The SECRETARY-GENERAL emphasised his strong oonviction that the Assembly was in favour of a system of roulement and in fact it nod only with great difficulty been persuaded up till now to re-elect the sa>ae members,
. Professor ATTOLICO wondered whether it was necessary to retain in the recommendations Of the Commi tteo the rathor pedagogical provision that the mandates of the eleoted Members of tho Counoil could be revoked.
The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the provision was dus to the double desire that the Assembly should retain the power accorded tG it in the Covenant of freely Ghoosing the Members of the Counoil and that, in fact, mandates should not as a rule be recalled,
There was general agreement that the present clear right of the Assembly to reoall mandates should not be limited.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that since this right was inherent in tne Assembly the OymmitteeTs recommendation was
unnecessary,
Mr .mcKINNQN //OQD said that formerly it was doubtful whether tho assembly could bind itself not to recall a mandate.
After the ratification of Article 4 it was possible that the Assembly might bind itself.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL concluded that it would bo possible by suitable drafting to safeguard the liberty of the Assembly while modifying the actual recconendation of tho Committee.
-n-
Proressor aTTOLICO thought that the i.iuediate practioal implications of the Discussion '"/era l) that the Committee should consider the possibility of adjourning its examination
v	>
of the question of permanent seats; 2) that tho liberty of the Assembly to recall mandates should be safeguarded in such language as would not appear as a threat of revocation;
3) that the question of ro-eligibility might be reconsidered if by a new solution of it the political crisis could be solved„
Tho SECRETARY-GENERAL, reverting to Professor AttolicoTs defence of the nresent system, said that in his opinion the Assembly would not consent, out of so small a total of elected members, to name some as re-cligible» Therefore, the only chance of making Spain re-eligible was to adopt the proposals of the Committee or something similar, To put It frankly, much as a majority of tho Assembly desired to have Spain always on the Council, it was not prepared to sacrifice the "roulement" even for that object»
Ar. C01BAN aided that if the promise of ^roulement" were withdrawn,many mombere which would have supported the Committee's proposals because they provided for ’'roulement"
'would oppose them as at heart they disliked the increase of elected members. He hoped that the Committee would not re-reo-oen questions of detail and in agreement with A.Hadariaga he thought it essential that nothing irrevocable should be said by the Committee with reference to Spain's claim for a permanent seat.
IX.	After a discussion of certain recent incidents bearing on
the use of languages other than English and French at committoos, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was important that in all
-12-
conuitteos of the League the present rules of procedure should he observed, whereby any member speaking in a language other than English or ¿Vouch should provide his ovrn interpreter.
The only possible concossion which might be made was that members of committees appointed in their own personal capacity and not as representatives of ¿overments who wore unable to speak in English or ¿'ranch might be interpreted by the Secretariat interpreters.
Professor ATTOT.ICO suggested that in order that this practice might be definitely established before the newt session of the Assembly, the Secretary-General should issue a circular to the secretaries of ooiami ssions to that effect.

Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL informe le Comité au sujet de la Commission pour la Réforme du Conseil. M. Guani et Mr Motta sont tombés d'accord pour qu'elle soit ajournée. M. Mrtta a émis l'espoir qu'elle ne siège pas entre le 20 Juillet et le 20 Août. On ne peut pas prévoir quand elle se réunira, mais la date la plus probable semblerait être peu avant le Conseil de septembre.
M. CATASTINI informe que la Commission des Mandats siège encore et qu'elle terminera probablement ses travaux vendredi soir.
M. BERG fait savoir que le Comité d'Enquête en Perse est .entrain de rédiger son rapport. Il ajoute avoir reçu une lettre du Gouvernement persan priant le Secrétariat de bien vouloir lui transmettre le projet de rapport avant qu'il soit présenté au Conseil, de sorte qu'il puisse faire connaître son point de vue
a ce sujet.
Lg SECRETAIRE GERER .;:.L croit qu'il ne peut y avoir aucune objection à co nue le projet de rapport soit envoyé au Gouvernement persan.
M. BERG fait alors remarquer que dans cos conditions lo rapport ne pourra être présenté à la prochaine session du Conseil.
Le SECRET'IRE GrETERiJj observe que la question n’est pas urgente et le rapport peut être présenté plus tard.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER fait savoir que le Comité Financier se réunira probablement à Londres le 15 Juillet pour la question de l'emprunt bulgare. Il devra aussi s’occuper d’une question de détail concernant l’emprunt hongrois.
En réponse à une question posée par M. ATTOLICO, Sir Arthur S ALTER informe que les démarches nécessaires ont été initiées en effet au sujet de l’emprunt bulgare auprès do la Commission des Réparations et ou’il espère qu’à la réunion du Comité Financier à Londres l'on pourra prendre les mesures envisagées pour permettre une avance sur l'emprunt.
M. MAETOUX résume les diverses conversations qu’il a eues avec le Représentant de la Lithuanie et d'autres personnalités lithuaniennes et il est convaincu que le changement de gouvernement qui a eu lieu dans ce pays aura une répercussion favorable sur l'orientation de la politique intérieure et probablement même sur la politique étrangère.
Sir ARTHUR 3.-..LÏJ3R Lnformo qu'un banquier américain lui a déclaré à propos de la Lithuanie, que nulle opération financière concernant ce pays pourrait être envisagée sans la garantie de la Société dos Rations. Il est d’avis qu'une situation délicate est
s
entrain de se créer, c'est-a-dire que les "banques tendent à n'assumer les risques d'opérations financières avec les pays qui nécessitent des mesures de reconstruction que si elles sont garanties par la Société des dations, ce qui peut devenir très embarrassant et engageant pour elle. Jusqu’à présent l'intervention de la Société des bâtions en matière financière s'est bornée aux pays dont la situation économique a été directement atteinte par la guerre, ou par une cause spéciale comme l'afflux de réfugiés.
M. AVENOL est d'avis qu'il faut faire une distinction entre les cas où l'initiative d'un emprunt est prise par la Société des Nations et ceux où la Société des Nations se limite à-assumer le contrôle sur les garanties de l'emprunt. Il fait remarquer qu'une dos plus grosses difficultés des opérations financières d'avant-guerre était la possibilité de s'assurer un contrôle sur et impartial.
M. MADARIAGA. adhère au point de vue e.e M.- AYENQL et fait ressortir qu'étant donné qu'une opération financière peut avoir des répercussions sur le maintien de la paix, 1'intervention de la Société des Nations peut se justifier,
II. LIAS XIN1T0N WOOD dit avoir eu une conversation aveo M. Srich au sujet d'un Institut pour les recherches scientifiques que l'on voudrait créer en Finlande en le plaçant sous le patronage de la Société des Nations. D'après ce qu'il croit avoir compris, le but du fondateur serait de chercher ce patronage pour assurer à l'institut un prestige qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas sans cela. S'il en était ainsi, le Conseil se refuserait d'assumer le contrôle de cette institution.
ne
Le SECRETAIRE CEDERAI observe que la Société des Nations pourrait accepter le patronage de l'institution que si elle se ésenti.it dans des conditions analogues a celles de l'Institut de
4
Coopération Intellectuelle de Paris et de celui pour l'Unification du droit privé de Rome.
Sir HERBERT AMES déclare avoir été frappé par une résolution adoptée récemment par une Union d1 Associations pour la Société des Hâtions recommandant aux différents gouvernements d'accepter les réserves des Etats-Unis au statut de la Cour Internationale de Justice. Il considère une telle attitude de la part d'organisations qui soutiennent l'idée de la Société des Hâtions comme un peu dangereuse.
Ivl. MAUTOUX attire l'attention sur un article publié par David Hunter Miller au sujet desditos réserves des Etats-Unis.
Il résume le contenu de cet article sur lequel d'ailleurs il a envoyé une note au SECRETAIRE GHNLRaL. Pcut-ôtre la question pourrait-elle être examinée à une prochaine réunion du Comité des Directeurs.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL remarque que la thèse de David Hunter Miller qu'à un renvoi à la Cour pour un avis consultatif, les votes des parties intéressées ne soient pas pris en considération, se réfère au cas contemplé par l'article 15 du Pacte.
Pour ce qui concerne les décisions du Conseil pour demander l'avis
o
consultatif de la Cour, on peut envisager 3 hypothèses : 1 - que l'unanimité absolue soit nécessaire, 2°- qu'il faille 1'unânimité sans le vote des parties intéressées, 3°- qu'il suffise uns simple majorité.
M. AVEEOL est d'avis que de quelque façon que l'on arrive à l'unanimité, avec ou sans le vote des parties intéressées, on ne peut pas penser que cette décision, qui est toujours le résultat d'un effort de conciliation long et difficile puisse être opposée par un Gouvernement qui n'a pas pris part à la discussion et qui ne considère la question que d'un point du vue subjectif.
5
Sir ARTHUR SALTBR se déclare du même a^is.
Le SECRETAIRE GSHERAL déclare qu'en tous cas il est indiscutable qu'on ne peut donner aux réserves américaines aucune interprétation qui restreigno l'activité du Conseil.
Sir HERBERT AMES demande, au cas où la Société des Rations assume une attitude contraire aaxdites réserves, quelle pourrait en être la répercussion aux Etats-Unis.
Sir Arthur SAUTER répond que le respect pour la Société des Rations y gagnera.
Dr EORMAN V/EITE informe sur les travaux du Congrès sanitaire oui a siégé à Paris. Il est d'avis que la Convention sanitaire dont on a discuté le projet est meilleure que celle de 1912.
Elle réserve à l'Office International d'Hygiène Publique à Paris de nombreuses attributions. L'Office International sur la collaboration de la Société des Rations dans son activité dont on n'a cependant pas encore décidé la forme exacte. En réponse au Secrétaire Général il se déclare d'avis que la Convention ne pourra pas être ratifiée avant un certain temps-.
M. MADARIAGn se réfère aux travaux de la Commission Préparatoire pour la Conférence du Désarmement. Il est k prévoir que la Commission plénière ne puisse rocommencer ses travaux avant janvier ou février.
M. ATTOLICO attire l'attention sur la réponse donnée par M. Chamberlain à une interpellation qui lui a été faite k lu Chambre des Communes sur 1'attitude du Brésil et de l'Espagne vis-à-vis de la Société des Rations. M. ATTOLICO a remarqué que M. Chamberlain en parlant de l'Espagne s'est exprimé de façon k faire comprendre
6
qu’il s’attendait à co que colle-ci agît comme le Brésil,
IL MADARTAGA a l'impression que l’attitude de 1’ r)s p<-» gne est en effet très tenace, tout en estimant personnellement qu’elle soit restée telle ou’il avait décrit dans la réunion précédente.

I.	The SBCiETAEf-QDlLLEAl, referring to the arénelo, of
the Seventh Session of the Assembly, asked, whether on I ten 13 (report of the work of the Economic and Financio. 1 organisation) a special report should he prepared for the Assembly or whether the relevant part of the report on the work ox the Council should he reprinted as an Assembly document.
Sir Arthur SALTEE sand that the Economic Committee always made a point of preparing a special report for the Assembly though this, as a rule, followed closely the relevant part of the report on the work of the Council. He hoped to induce then to be content with a re pint ox the latter.
With reference to Item 15 (report on the work of the Organisation on Communications and Transit) Hr. HAAS said that the relevant part of the work on the work of the Council
-2 -
II .
was reprinted for the Assembly.
With reference to Item 16 (report on the work of the Health Organisation of the League}. Dr. RAJCEIAH said that a detailed report for the year ending December 31st,1925, had been published by the Health Section which could be circulated to the Assembly Delegates. He suggested that in the circumstances a reprint of the two chapters in the Report of the Council dealing with the period January to August* 1926 * would suffice as a supplementary report.
The SBCEETAHY-GBEISAL agreed to this procedure.
It was agreed that with reference to Itons 17,
18 and 19, the relevant parts of the report on the work of the Council would be reprinted for the Assembly.
Hr. HCICNI'OIT '/ODD said that the Assembly would be- ad lecL upon to deal with the question of the amendment of the Provident Fund, and presumably the Council at its September Session would ask the Assembly to place that question on its agenda.
The SECHETAHY-GEHHTAL said that the Council would presumably adopt the same procedure- with regard to the report on the- Armenian Scheme.
The SGcretary-Senera 1 said that the Council had decided to refer to the 4th Committee of the Assembly the report on contributions in arrears. The* report itself would be submitted to the 4th Committee only, thG Assembly receiving a note to explain that this was being done.
Hr. C01'BAII raised the question whether the report
of the Hirst Committee of the Special »Session of the assenDly
3
on tiio Acini ssi on of Go many could constitutionally bo c ansidorod-as before the Seventh Session of the Assembly or whether the Seventh Session would have to adopt a now report.
il. lAFTCrX thought that the constitutional Question was not cl together clear. It might be necessary for the Committee to readout for fora’s sake the report adopted in March.
The SCCMCTA?Ar-GC1MXAL said that the President in his speech proposing to the Assembly the distribution among committees of items on the agenda night recall the adoption by the First Committee of the March assembly of this report on the admission of Germany and say that, therefore, that report could be considered as before the -assembly and need not bo referred again to a committee. V/e should bo guided finally by deve 1 o pmc nt s .

The £CCRD 2LrOT-GEiTM directors on the question of ,TXTT files as put forward by 1926) and commented on by Dr 1926 ) .
asked for the views of the arrangement of documents in Mr. Colban (Confidential Circular . Eajchnan (Confidential Circular

8a,
Mr. COLBAil said that there were two sides to the question:	1) the present practice in the arrangement of docu-
ments in ,TZ” files (that is, files which contained more than one
inc	cm inf?	lot	ter) did	no	t permit of	chr	onolog	ical	order		being

alternative systems proposed:
orvod that thoro wore l) that originally pr
mr. Colban that all the incoming and outgoing cor reap should he on the right side of the file and all the 3 minutes on the loft; 2) the system proposed by Dr. that each document should be immediately followed by
two
oposed by
oudence
ocretariat
•del j C ik-lB II
the minute
!s
belonging to it.
mr. ILWiVD said that from the Registry point of view there its a no great difficulty in the adoption of either system, but he did not altogether like the former, as in the case of many files, for instance, files containing a largo number of reciuests for documents at different times, it was awkward to hove the minutes separated from the documents.
The SaCli3TA3Y-G3NV3AL said that he personally preferred the system proposed by Dr. liajehwan, though if this wore adopted it was essential that a new minute sheet should be used whenever the first minute sheet had been covered by the addition of a new document to the file. flic essential thing was that chronological order should be preserved and that it should always be apparent to what document a minute referred. minutes intended to remain on files should not bo written on blue slips.
11 was agreed that this system should ba adoptod.
It was also agreed that the He pastry, in consultation with sections, should have a separate file made for new incoming letters when the original file became too bulky,
• Jr. GILCH3I3T proposed that a new green sheet should be inserted for each new incoming letter.
mr. HVVVHD said that this snould bo done.
~5-
n-
There was some discussion of -the procedure in ¿leaps'.tching letters. It was agreed that someone in each section, presumably the secretary of the section, should "be solely r os possible for the despatch of letters sent direct from that section. It v/as the duty of the despatching officer to see that on the carbon copies of letters so despatched should ho entered the dato on which ohch letter was despatched and the name of the official who signed it. The same should he done hy the Registry in despatching letters.
7.	her. GILCHRIST said that an interesting feature of the
session of the Permanent .mandates Commission which had just ended was that out of the nine territories of which reports had been discussed, six had been represented by officials with a direct knowledge of those territories.
71.	kr. HAAS said that the Committee on the Reform of the
Calendar had held a final meeting. There was agreement on the question of the fixing of Easter, subject to subsequent consent by tho Vatican. The position as regards the Vatioan was that though there was no dogmatic obstacle to the fixing of Easter, the present method was hallowed by a tradition of such longstanding that it should not be changed without the approval of Oecumenical Council. The question would bo submitted to the next 0 ecumenical Council, which should meet within the next few years.
On tho bigger question of the Reform of the Calendar tho Committee had decided not to recommend any immediate action, but to suggest that the League should adjourn its consideration of the question, resuming it when occasion arose.
,rH*	Sir Arthur S.TLTER drew attention to the fact that
. at midnight of that day the League's work for the financial reconstruction of mustria would come to an end.

1.	The Provisional Agenda for the next mooting of the Council was examined and approved, with certain changes.
2.	The Deputy Secretary^General sail that a notice uould shortly he sent round to all Sections about the Supplementary Agenda for the Assembly. Sections would be asked, (l) to consider whether they had any questions to be placed on the Supplementary Agenda; (2) whether they wished to make any ohanges in the Agenda already circulated.
He hoped that answers would be sent in with as little delay as possible.
3.	Monsieur --anteux drew attontion to the fact that, whereas the Reports on the York of the Council and tho Secretariat provided a complete official summary of the work of the League, with the exception of that which took place in the Assembly itself, there was no corresponding publication which summarised the «.ssambly rs own work.

Professor ATTOLICO Dr. NITOBE M. MuNTOUM Sir Arthur SALTER M. COLBAIT M« C OMER T M. IIADAEIAGa Dame Rachel CROwD Y M. HAaS
Mr. McEIKNOi: WOOD Mr. WALTERS M. DENIS M. BONNET Dr. BOUDREAU Mr. BIELER M. FRIIS
Mr. WIJjSON, Secretary.
I.	The Secretary-General proposed that the meeting should have a general discussion of Confidential Circular 14.1926•(annex), and that a committee should afterwards be formed to draw up the final programme.
Monday morning.
The Secretary-General ashed II. Bonnet to draft a speech for M. Ben^s. He thought it would be good if the speech included some reminder to the Assembly that the ratification of conventions drawn up unc er League auspices was not proceeding quite as well as it might, and that it hardly seemed wise to proceed to the framing nf new conventions while those that had already been passed remained so long- unratified.
-2-
Ilonday afternoon.
With reference to the assignment of the various questions on the agenda to the sin Committees,
1.1« Hadariaga said that, in his opinion, the Third Committee should be put in the way of discussing Disarmament, as there was an impression, due to the inevitable slowness of the technical preparatory work, that nothing was being done. What should be the procedure? Should the Assembly decide to submit to the Third Committee the Chapter on Disarmament in the Supplementary Deport on the Work of the Council, or should a separate Progress Report be prepared?
Hr. Walters said that, as the Report on the Work of the Preparatory Committee was on the agenda (Item 20), there was no doubt that the Committee would be given something to discuss.
It was agreed that the account of the Work of the Preparatory Committee in the Supplementary Report should be printed separately as a progress Report with reference to Item 20.
M.	asked that the committee which was
to be appointed to draw up the final programme should take into account the desirability of arranging that the First and Fourth Committees should not meet at the same time, as some leading delegates would want to sit on both Committees - on the First, because it would be dealing with the Report on the Composition of the Council; - on the Fourth, because the Budget would be
particularly interesting this year
-3-
Iho Secretary-General doubted whether it was wise that the President should make the proposal that the Assembly should vote for the admission of Germany on a given date, before the General Committee of the Assembly had been set up.
Hr. Walters said that the proposal had been made for two reasons: 1} because it seemed advisable for tiio admission to take placo at the earliest possible moment; £} bect.use the Assembly would probably wish to appoint a German delegate as a Vice-President.
professor Attolioo thought it essential that the General Committee should be sot up before this cuestión was touched at all. The Assembly could decide to appoint another Vice-President after the admission of Germany.
The Seci etary-Generaj. agreed.
In reply to the Secretary-General, Mr. HcMinnon
there
Wood thought/was no doubt that the Assembly lied the right constitutionally to consider Item II (the heport on the Admission of Germany) without further reference to a Committee.
Professor Attolico thought it would bo better if the President were to say that he would consult the General Committee with regard to the form in which Item 11 should be submitted to the Assembly. In any case, it was essential that the president, if he were to propose that the Report should be- considered without further reference to a Committee, should do so in such; a
-4-
wey as to show that he was not wishing to avoid discussion of that procedurek Should delegates prefer it to be altered,
The Secret: ry-General agreed with the second observation of Professor Attolico, which he thought fully safeguarded the rights of delegates, but, that being understood, he preferred that the President should nabs some such statement as proposed, >~w« w 0 U iiv 01 .* uull simply add that the question of
the date when the Report should be considered by the Assembly would be decided by the General Committee. If any question were raised as to reference to a Committee, he could then suggest that the Bureau should consider this point and male a proposal to the Assembly.
Tuesday morning.
The Secretary-General said th~t the procedure on Tuesday morning would thus be the sane as at the Siicth Session of the Assembly, i.e3, the Committees would meet at intervals from 10 a.rn.to elect their Presidents. The Assembly would meet at midday to hear the announcement of the names of the Presidents of the Committees aid to elect the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. The President would then announce that the General Committee was duly constituted.
On Tuesday afternoon, the General Committee might meet at 3. and decide on the date of the admission of Germany. Afterwards, the Committees would meet to elect their own officers.
There followed the question when the procedure set down in Confident Circular 14, 19B6, for Tuesday morning (Admission of Germany and Election to a Permanent Seat) could tahe place.
-5-
The German Consul had called to inform him that the German delegation desired not to leave for Geneva until the Council h_d finally adopted a proposal recommending Germany for a permanent seat. This would mean that the German delegates could not take their place at the Assembly before Friday morning. Then, either the Assembly should vote on the Council's proposal on Wednesday mornin0, in which case there mould be an interval of two days between the Assembly's approval of Germany as a permanent member and the German delegate.'s first speech, or the Council having made its proposal on Wednesday morning, the Assembly might vote on it only on Friday, so that the German delegate could reply immediately.
It would, of course, be preferable if the German delegates could appear on Wednesday morning, but this would mean that the Council should take a contingent decision with reference to the permanent seat before the admission of Germany to the League. He did not think the Council would do this, nor did it seem to him very dignified.
Professor Attolico thought there was a way out. The Council, meeting, say, on Saturday, could, without taking a contingent vote on the granting of a permanent seat, nevertheless authorise the Seeretary-General to give a formal assurance to the German Government that, after Germany’s admission to the League, there would be no difficulty at the Council with reward to the nomination of Germany to a permanent seat. He urged strongly that this should be the method adopted, as it was very desirable that the German delegates should take their place on Wednesday. Would not the German Government be satisfied with a "gentleman’s agreement'1 of that kind?
\
-e-
Tho Secretary-General thou^vht they would, and a,arced that this ’-’oulcl be much the best solution, if the Council would adopt it.
The Secretury-General thought that, if the admission of Germany, the speech of the German delegate and the answering speeches could all tale place on Wednesday, the Assembly might, for the next two or three days, meet in the morning for the debate on the deport of the t/orh of the Council, while in the afternoon the first Committee could consider the Report of the Committee on the Composition of the Council.
K.	Colban wondered whether it would not be better to leave the first two or three days entirely free for the Committee’s discussion of the Report on the Composition of the Council.
The Secretary-General said that he preferred that, on the whole, the Assembly should meet in the morning. Iloreover, if Germany were admitted only on Friday* he thought that it would be best that the Assembly’s debate on the Report on the Work of the Couicil should alone be held in the interim, the Committee not discussing the Report on the Composition of the Couicil until after Germany’s admission»
Professor Attolico hoped that, after the speech by the German delegate on Germany’s admission* other speeches would be as short as possible and in the nature of declarations.
It was necessary that 3ome of the speeches should tahe place as usual in the debate on the Y/orh of the Council.

The Secretary-General suggested that the Secretaries of Committee should he as follows:

¿.i* Ftiis said that the T’ortuguese Government had informed the Secretary-General of agreements "between itself ana the Government of the Union of South Africa with regard to (1) the frontier between Angola and the Mandated Territory of South-West Africa and (2) the waters of the Cunene Hiver. The agreement had certainly been facilitated by the question being brought into prominence by the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council.
5.	M• Eaas said the Transit Committee had held a satisfactory meeting. There had also been two special committee meetings: (1) the Committee on Private Law concern ing Inland navigation in iurope had been held at Hamburg - the first meeting of a League Committee in Germany. The members had been well received by the authorities. (2) The Committee on the Lighting of Coasts had held a meeting at Stockholm.
6.	The Secretary-General said that the Lithuanian Government had sent him a letter examining the memorandum
of the Diet ox Hemal, which had been brought to the notice of the Council by the four principal Allied Powers signatory to the Convention. At the same time the Lithuanian Government protested against the procedure adopted by the Council in respect of Memel petitions. The Government would, he thought, accept an opinion of the court, and on the whole he thought it best that this opinion should be sought.
- 9 -
7.	LI. Madariaga said that the United States Minister at Berne had informed him: (1) that a speech by Mr. hellog was to he published denying that the United States Government was dissatisfied with the treatment of the Disarmament question at Geneva; (2) that the Government desired that the Military Sub-Committee should continue to work as long as possible and avoid adjournment till the last moment.
8.	There was some discussion on the conference summoned for the 1st September with regard to the United States reservation concerning its adhesion to the Protocol of the
P e rmane nt C ourt.
Professor Attolico thought it unlineIy that the conference would, within a few days, be able to agree on the terms ox the reply which the signatories to the Protocol should address to the United ¡states Government. It might prefer to appoint an expert sub-Committee to report to it at a later meeting - perhaps some three months hence.
The becretary-General had no radical objection to such a procedure, but hoped that on the whole delegates to the Conference, who were themselves mostly legal experts and had had three months* notice of the Conference, would be able it least to agree on certain common principles which the Governments might embody in their replies to the U,ix to cl u u wCb o v e x men u.

Mr. Falters Mr. Abraham Mr. Haas Mr 9 Bonno t,
Mr. Gilchrist Mr. Biel er Mr. Huston
Mr. Wilson, Secretary.
1.	The meeting discussed a Note setting forth a possible
programme for the Assembly from Wednesday to Saturday (Annex 1'),
The SECRET ARY-GENERAL said that he had learned from Herr vcn Billow, who had visited him, that the German Government had decided not to send its delegation to Geneva until all the formalities connected with Germanyrs entry were completed. At the Secretary-General's request Herr von Billow had said the he would t ask the Government whether its delegates could not leave after
"the vote by the Council On the Permanent Seat, so that they could enter the Assembly hall immediately after the Assembly's vote on Friday morning.
I
2
Mr. COLBAR thought that it might be wiser if in any case all the formalities were completed on the Wednesday.
Professor ATTOLICO agreed^ The German Government, having taken a certain line, should accept the consequences, namely, that the first appearance of their delegates would he less glorious than it might otherwise have been..
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that the German attitude was not unreasonable and hoped that it would he possible to postpone the final vote until Friday.
Mr. CCMERT agreed that this would be best from the publicity point of view. On the other hand it would have a bad effect if it were known that the German Government had refused to accept the Secretary-General's proposal.
It was agreed that if the German Government accepted it the programme before the meeting would stand, otherwise the Assembly's vote on the Council's Resolution shoxiid he held on on Wednesday morning.
Professor ATTOIICO observed how difficult it would be to gat speakers for the Assembly's debate on the Council on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday.
The SECRETARY-GEKERAL agreed, but saw no alternative to the programme proposed. If this programme was not acceptable the General Committee could meet to decide on another.
2.	The meeting considered the "Rote sur 1' organic ation
de la 7eme Session de 1 'Assembles,T (Annex 2)
III.
To the work of the 1st Committee should be adds' items V n.nn R of the Agenda.
3
After sôme discussion it was agreed that Item 19 (Intellectual Co-operation) should stay with the 2nd Committee instead rf being transferred, as was a possible alternative, to the 5th Committee.
IV.
Sir Arthur SALTER and Dr, RAJCHMAW asked that Mr. Smets and Mr. Hamblen should not be expected to take the minutes of the Committee except for work which concerned thoir respective secti ons.
Mr. COL MIT said that he was prepared to allow one of his staff for full time and another for half time to be available for minute writing, He did not wish to go beyond this.
It was agreed that in principle the Sections should he responsible for providing minute writers for the work which concerned them. Mr. Huston would, in consultation with the Sections concerned, make final arrangements, as regards the minute writers for the 2nd and 5tli Committees. It was understood that the Secretaries cf Committees were responsible for seeing that the various minute writers were told when they were wanted.
M. M&NTOUZ said that he proposed. M. Roddolo as Secretary of the Agenda Committee.
The SECRETARY-GEHERAL said that should M. Nintchitch be elected President of the Assembly, he would like Mr.Popovitch to collaborate with the secretaries of the President and the General Committee.
3.	The meeting considered the "Provisional Agenda of the
41st Session of the Council" showing the order in which it was suggested the items should be taken (Annex 3), Various changes were made which Mr. Buxton was asked to embody in a revised agenda,
4
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Conference on the U*S.A. reservations would he held at the International Labour Office. Though the Conference was not, strictly, a League conference, a member of the Information Section should attend in order to issue any communiqué which the Conference might wish to make.
The Secretary-General said, that it was very desirable that the Conference should meet in public, as secrecy would certainly be misunderstood in the U.SoA.
5.	Mr. COMERT said that 2,OCO Swiss francs would be
necessary to make the lighting arrangements for the taking of cinema films at the Assembly. If it was desired that films should be taken, the question arose whether the League should pay the money and admit operators freely or whether a fee of 100 or S00 Swiss francs should be charged.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was essential that the Secretariat should not ho under any obligation to the cinematograph firms as might bo the case if a fee were charged. He should he left free to decide when films could ha taken and if sd fey how long. He did not think that the delegates would Object to the small sum involved being paid by the League.
Professor ATTOIICO agreed that this was the better alternative, hut reminded the Secretary-General that the Supervisory Commission was inclined to grudge expenditure on propaganda.
°*	Mr.CCMERT said that an official of the Internationa,,
labour Office had made a proposal that one or two loose sheets, setting forth the work of the International Labour Organisation, should be distributed with the Monthly Summary.
5
Professor ATT OU GO said that though ho was not able to form a final opinion on the spot he did not altogether like the idea . bTho Secretariat would have no control over the material supplied by the International Labour Office, hut if objections were raised the Secretariat might he held responsible*
Mr. COMERT thought that the responsibility of the Secretariat would be covered by a note showing that the information regarding the International Labour Office was supplied on the responsibility of the International Labour Office alone. Already information concerning the Gourt supplie! on its authority was inserted in the Summary. He was anxious to avoid any kind of responsibility or control while he did not want to reject this offer of collaboration from the International Labour Office.
Professor ATTOIICO said that this was a case in which no compromise was possible. Either the Secretariat assumed responsibility or it assumed none. If it assumed none the pages on the International Labour Organisation should be separate from the Summary.
It was finally agreed, on the proposal of Dr. RAJCHMAK, that the pages on the International Labour Organisation should be presented as a separate leaflet of the same format as the Summary, containing a note that the material was supplied by and on the responsibility of the International Labour Office. This leaflet could be enclosed in the same envelope a3 the Summary. The International Labour Office should be asked to limit its material ■to three or four pages.
•	Sir Arthur SALTER said that the advances required for
"the pgriod antecedent to the floating of the Bulgarian Loan had been obtained.
6
S.B.	Since this meeting took place, the German Govern-
ment have definitely informed the Secretary-General that their delegates cannot leave for Geneva till all 3 resolutions are taken. It will he therefore necessary to have those passed as soon as possible on Wednesday. It is very desirable that there should be no public knowledge that any other alternative was placed before the German Government.

A chaque Commissi on, un membre du Secrétariat sera spécialement chargé de la rédaction du procès-verbal, ainsi que de la préparation du compte-rendu résumé des séances, destiné à paraître dans le ''Journal de 1 Assemblée":
1ère Commission	: M.	Solym

Politique et des Mandats.
Pour les questions intéressant particulièrement une Section, cette Section prêtera sa collaboration à l'établissement des procès-verbaux.
En outre, un Document Officer devra être désigné par Le Secrétaire de la Commission.
MM. de Ivîonten&ch et Wilson pourraient être chargés des fonctions de Secrétaire du Président et du Bureau de l'Assemblée.
4
Los Sections ne doivent pus compter sar le service ¿es préds-writers pour l'établissement d'aucun procès-verbal des séances des connaissions consultatives qui pourraient être tenues pendant la durée de 1!Assemblée; elles auront à assurer elles-mêmes la rédaction des procès-verbaux de ces séances.
M. Huston, les Secrétaires des Commissions, les chefs des Services administratifs régleront ensemble toute question de matériel ou de personnel qui pourrait se poser.
Rien ne sera changé aux diverses publications éditées par le Secrétariat pendant l'Assemblée (Journal de l'Assemblée comprenant des résumés très brefs établis par le Secrétariat sans être soumis aux Délégués ayant pris part aux débats, et n'ayant aucun caractère officiel. - Comptes-rendus in extenso des séances plénières). Les procès-verbaux des Commissions seront publiés seulement après l'Assemblée, pour éviter certaines observations sur les procès-verbaux des Commissions, peut-être conviendrait-il de rappeler les conditions dans lesquelles le texte définitif de ces procès-verbaux sera établi. A cet effet, le Secrétaire général pourrait, comme l'année dernière, adresser une note au Bureau de l'Assemblée. Après examen par le Bureau, cette note serait transmise par lui aux présidents des Commissions, qui en donneraient lecture a chaque Commission.
(le texte de la note adressée l'année dernière aux présidents des Commissions se trouve dans le (Journal Officiel, supplément spécial Ec 28, pages 9-10).
V.	Les Secrétaires des Commissions devront indiquer
clairement, aussitôt que possible aux Commissions, les documents qui sont mis à leur disposition et qui contiennent les éléments d'information sur les points qu'elles auront à discuter, Il est
- 5 -
désirable que la marohe du. travail des Commissions et l’ordre dans lequel les questions diverses seront abordées, soient réglés, autant que possible, d’avance.
Afin d’assurer l’unité du travail entre les différentes Commissions une réunion dos Secrétaires des Commissions aura lieu sur convocation dans le bureau du Secrétaire général adjoint avant la séance de l’Assemblée, de façon que le Secrétaire général puisse être tenu quotidiennement au courant du progrès des discussions et régler en conséquence l’ordre du jour des séances de 1’Assemblée.
Il y aurait avantage à ce que les rapporteurs chargés de présenter à l’Assemblée les résolutions adoptées par les Commissions fussent désignés aussitôt que possible. Toutefois, ceci ne sera certainement pas faisable dans tous les cas, la plupart des Commissions préfèrent choisir pour les représenter devant l’Assemblée un de leurs membres dont les vues correspondent manifestement à celles de la majorité.

Geneva, 2nd October 1926.
MINUTES GP THE DIRECTORS' MEETING.
Wednesday. September 29th. 1926.
PRESENT:	The SECRETARY-GENERAL
Professor ATTOLICO Dr. NITOBE Sir Arthur SiiLTER M. COLB AN M. COMERT Ur, RAJCHMAN M. MANTCUX M. ae MALAR IA GA M. CaTASTINI M. HaAS
Mr. McKIKNOK WOOL M. QUESNAY Mr. BIELPE
Mr. WILSON (Secretary) 1
1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Seventh Session of
the Assembly had shown tho following defeats:
(e) There had been a particularly heavy strain on the Secretariat.
(b)	The Presidents of Committees had net all been as competent as might be wished.
(c)	The ond of the Session had been rushed as delegates had dooidod that it must come to an end by Saturday, 25th September,
As regards (a), the difficulty was that praotically all the work of the Assembly had boon rushed through in the last ten days. If the work had been ovenly distributed ever the throe weeks, the strain on the Secretariat would not hare boon so great. The unequal distribution of work was duo to tho exceptional oiroumstancos of the last session, and it was not to be expected that it would be the same at future sessions.
-2-
Profescor ATTOL1CO, in agreeing with the Secretary-General on this point, added that the work of the session had baon complicated by the meeting, simultaneous with the assembly, of the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference, and of the Conference on the American Reservations, also by the fact that the Sixth Committee of the Assembly was used as a conference to draw up an international conrcnticn ion Slavery}.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed that, in future, the meeting of important committees or conferences at the same time as the Assembly should be avoided, and ho was also convinced that it was unwise to use the Assembly as a conference for drawing up international conventions.
Sir Arthur SALTER, while admitting that conventions on speoial subjects oould not be satisfactorily drawn up by the Assembly, thought that on subjects germane to the LoagueTs essential function, the Assembly might suitably go beyond the adoption of resolutions in general terms. Epr instanoe, it might formulate in some detail the principles of a policy without embodying it in conventual form. The subjects dealt with in the Protoool for the paoifio Settlement of International Disputes wore amongst these whioh the Assembly might properly have dealt with in this way.
Mr. MoKIiilOE WOOD thought that when a resolution was submitted te the Assembly in the course of its session, the substanoe of it should not be considered unless the natter was of real urgenoy. The final decision on the British Resolution regard regarding the competence of the League had indeed been postponed > till the next session, but this should have been done as scon as it was brought up, whereas, in fact* it had been largely diaoussed at the session.
3
(b)	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it was becoming difficult to find competent presidents of committees differing in nationality from those who had presided at former sessions. The only solution seemed to be that the notion that the representatives of the great Powers should not preside over committees should be given up. Satisfaction could be given to States not yet represented on the General Committee of the Assembly by choosing them as Vice-Presidents*
In reply to M. de MADARIAGA., the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that representatives of great Powers chosen as presidents of oormiittees need not be the first delegates of those Powers. In any case there would be only one representative of any Power on the General Committee) of the Assembly.
Dr* RAJCHMAN ashed whether it would not be advisable that presidents who had proved their merit should be reelected at another session.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that a re-elected president would in some committees (such as the Fourth) lose his authority and would come to be regarded practically as an official.
It was agreed that the system outlined by the SECRETARY-GENERAL would be best, the presidents being chosen for their competence, and the representatives of great Powers not being excluded.
(c)	The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that delegates should be prepared to accept four weeks as the normal duration of an Assembly session. If the session could end in three weeks, well and good, but in any case delegates should not make definite engagements requiring their absence from Geneva before four weeks.
-4-
Profcssor ATTOLICO doubted wlstfrer delegates would givo up the belief that was now taking held that a session should normally last three weeks.
Sir Arthur SaLTER drew attention to the seriousness of the situation at the lust session when delegates had had to work under great pressure and, moreover, certain delegates hod felt themselves crowded out of the Assembly dsbates by the general desire to finish it at all oosts by a given date.
M. COLBAN thought that the Assembly would have a better ohanoo of working at a reasonable pace if it3 session were not immediately preceded or immediately followed by important League meetings.
The SEC RETARY-GERURAL was of opinion that the oommittoes should, so far as possible, consider first those items on their agenda which seemed likely to involve supplementary estimates. If these oould be submitted to the fourth Committee earlier, time would be saved.
Dr. RAJCHI.IAL thought one of the roasons why delegates were ancious to leave early was that tho disouasions were not interesting. He wondered if some indication might not be given before tho session to delegates likely to be chosen as presidents of tho respective oommittoo, sc that they oould study tho subjects and lead the discussions on them.
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that a distinction should be made between subjects in 'which the Assembly had simply to take account of what had already boon done and those in which the Assembly had to decide on a policy for the future. The subjeo^s dealt with by the SoCond Committee wore largely of the first kind and no real debate v/as possible upon thorn. He himself always me do an attempt to bring before the Committee the persons most qualified to explain the work of tbs League in those matters, as for instance, Mr, Howland on Creek Refugees and Mr. Tyler on the Reconstruction ox Hungary.
-5-
Dr. .RAJOHMAJJ admitted this distinction, but thought that in tho case of most of the itoms dealt with by the Committees, the interest of tho debate would bo increased if competent delegates had roully studied thoroughly ono or more speoial points which scorned suitable for debate. The difficulty at present was that the only delegates well briefed for Assembly debates wore the principal delegates when they made speeches on the report of the work of the Council. Tho speeohes in the Commissions, where after all the real work of the League was done should b^ equally well prepared.
M. COUBRT raised the following points:
a)	Ho wished to return to an idee which he had advocated previously that it would bo useful if, in the debate on the Report on the work ef the Council, delegates explained what had boon done in their respective countries to oarry out the recommendations of the Assembly.
b)	The reading in the Assembly of reports already distributed to delegates should be discontinued.
c)	He had beon informed several times this session that the interpretation of speeches had not always been satisfactory, whereas at the previous sessions there had been nothing but praise for the work of tho interpreters.
d)	Could not some means be invented to ensure that the meetings of the League committees should not inconveniently clash?
M. da MADARIAGA said that as regards (c), the cause was overwork. There were cases where interpreters at ths end of a long day had been literally unable to continue.
As regards (d) ths need for co-ordinating meetings of commissions and committees was, so far as he knew, already borne in mind in fixing the dates of meetings.
- 6 -
(b) M. I.IANTOUXt speaking as one versed in these natters, thought that though overwork night have been in some measure the cause of the alleged imperfections, the risk of inaccurate interpretation would be greatly lessened if interpreters - as y/as not always the case - took detailed notes.
Professor ATT03ZC0 said that he would look into the matter, but he hoped the directors would not take an exaggerated view of the case. After allf the League had the best interpreters v/hi c h we re a vc. i la b le .
The SECRETAIiY-GEliERAL said that though, on the whole, the work of the interpreters was very satisfactory, the point raised by LI. Hantoux - the taking of notes, deserved consideration and he hoped M. Attolico v/ould mention the matter to the Chiefs of the Interpreting Services.
Dr. IJAJCHMAtl thought that the Interpreter of the President, who always spoke French, should be an Englishman. Iluch sympathy was expressed with this view.
As regards point (d), the SECRdTAKf-GEFELAL suggested that all information concerning the meetings of the committees should be centralised in Professor Attolicors Department. This Department would then keep a list of future meetings of committees and Professor Attolico should himself always be consulted by secretaries of committees in cases where there was any possibility of a proposed meeting clashing with the meeting of another Committee.
M. CATAEMNI and M. HAAS drew attention to the great difficulty vdiich already existed indua-ing members of committees t® accept any given date for a meeting.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the object of the system proposed was not to add to the difficulties of secretaries, but
to ensure that a committee should meet in the most satisfactory
conditi on/
-7-
whioh he thought would he possible if some such co-ordination was effected through Professor Attolioo's Department.
Point (h). There was general agreement with M. COMFRT on this point, it being understood that the spooohos of rapporteurs, even if they consisted largely of quotations from reports, should bo translated, which had always been the oase at the last session of the Assembly.
Point (a) Professor aTTOLICO did not like this. It would make the Assembly ressmble a competitive exhibition.
M. C011SRT thought it would rather create a useful emulation between tho Members of the League. At present there were no means of ascertaining to vrh*t extent different oountriws had acted on the League's rooommend&tions.
Th« SECRETARY-GENERAL sold that praotioally all the nsoassury information vías to bo found in League publications (Por Ínstanos information concerning ratifications was given in the annex to the Report on the Work of the Counoil). If anyone wished to know wh&t any given country had done, ho could find it in these records, though there was certainly no publication of the League which showed, country by country, what had bean ¿one to carry out the Assembly Resolutions.
Ho, himsalf, did not think it would bo wise to present the information in such a way.
M. COLBAN thought that there was no harm in a delegate making e. declaration on what had bosn done in his country ■ n aomo specific question (e.g. on Minorities).
M. HAAS thought the non-ratification of League Conventions was dúe largely to the fact that the Foreign Offioes did not encourage and oo-ordinate suoh efforts as might bo made in the various tcohnioal departments. What was wanted was that the first delegate of a country at thu Assembly should bo placed in the position whore ho would feci culled upen te explain why conventions had not been ratified.
-8-
l'ho SECRLTnRY-GrEKERu: doubted whether it wes right to drew attention to the backwardness of specified countries in this way.
Sir Arthur SaLTER hoped that when it received the six months1 report on the state of ret ifioation of conventions, the Council should net simply toko noto of it, but should examine tb^ reasons for delays in ret ifioation.
M. da MiiLuRlnGi, suggested that aotion would bo most offactive if the Counoil concentrated its attention on ono convention at a time.
After some discussion, it was agreed that the most that oould be done was that the rapporteur in reports to tho Counoil should state that suoh-und-suoh a Conventi n had been ratified by X.Y.2. and not ratified by n.B.C.
Further, that the Council might decide to draw the attention of the assembly to the foot that a disoussion on the reasons for the ni.n-ratifioation of a given Convention might bo useful.
5.	The SECRETnR¿-GENJEUL said that, in his opinion, the
policy to be aimed at with regard to the British Resolution on tho competence cf tho League was that any definition of competence should follow the lines of the Preamble of tho Covenant itself wherein the League was defined as being formed, (l) to promote international oo-operation and [?,) to achiove international peaoo and security.
L.	Sir Arthur SaLTER said that a suggest! n had been
made that oountries which asked the technical help of the League should pay the expenses cf any enquiries whioh were necessary. ^ oase in point was that of the request cf Estbonia for finanoial advice. He was strongly of opinion that tho League should support these expenses, except, of course, if, as a result of enquiry, a special organisation was set up.
There was general agreement with this view.
-9
M.	OOLBAiJ thought that the experience of the lust session of the Assembly showed that it was host that the elections to the Council should take plaoo at the end of the session.
Only so Y/ould principal delegates remain to the end and the members retain th9ir interest.
It was decided that this question should bo considered
later,
y.	M, COLEAN said that roneod documents issuod by the
Secretariat were sometimes difficult to read. Could not bettor paper bo used?
Professor ATTOLIGO and Mr. BI3LEH; We use the best paper.
7.	M. HAAS said that tho tondmey of the Supervisory
Commission and of the Fourth Committee to decide on roquosts for funds on politioal rathor than budgetary grounds should be serieusly considered.
The S3 C KS T AR Y- G3K3EAI agreed with M. HaAS and thought that, if the Fourth Committee rejected a proposal on other than budgetary grounds, the Technical Committee, on being informed .•f the rejection of its proposal, should refuse to aooopt these reasons as outside the (competence of the Fourth Committee.
The proper piooeduro in his opinion was that the Technical Committee concerned should propose the Fourth Committee should discuss the proposal entirely from tho budgetary point of view, and finally, if .the decision of the Fourth Committee could not be aooeptod by the Teohnioal Oammittee, a joint committee should be formed. He also thought that the Technical Committees shauld not refrain from reoommonding polioios cf which they really approved, simply beoeuso thoy knew that delegates of tho Fourth Committee would vote against these pdioies.
Sir Arthur SAME HR thought'the whole question very difficult, as there was no analogy .to the kind of control which the Fourth
-10-
Goiamissisn of the Assembly should exercise. He Would sun up the position us follows: That whore the expenses involved in a preposnl wore relatively unimportant, the Technical Committee should be sola judge of the expediency of its adoption. On the other rand, where the expense was big in relation to the policy proposed (o.g. in the case of a proposal to build u new building) tho Fourth Committee should judge the question of expediency.
Professor efL’TOLIOO thought it, incidentally, useful to remind Directors that the examination ef the Budget by the Supervisory Commission next year would probably be even strioter than in former years.

The SECTMTALT-GEIJBRwL said that Gconomic Conference would meet in June or ./hen did Monsieur de Madariaga third: that
he thought the October of 192 7 . the Di Cu4 rraamen t
C onf e renc e wou Id meet?
Monsieur de MM)ARISG£. said that he thought that the pre sen t nee ting of Sub-C ommi t tees xiov. Id fini sh be x ore the end of the month. The Preparatory Committee might then meet about March or April 1927 . It would probably not finish its report before July. The Report would be long and if Governments were to consider it properly, the Conference could hardly meet before the Spring of 1928.
In reply to a ■ uestion, Mr. STOP PIT I said that he thought both the U.O.M., and the r.C.G.y., would be invited to
the Economic Conference. As it was a Conference of
Experts the Government of the U.S.A., might accept. The
Preparatory Committee for the Economic Conference was to
meet in ¥ ovemher. It won Id not draw tip a definite agenda
for the Conference hut would continue its collection of
documentation required. There was some indication that the
work of the Conference might fall under two main heads:-
(1). The statement of sound economic doctrine.
fs) . Proposals for some continuing organisation,
which, keeping in touch with important national and international industrial interests, would watch developments and make suggestions for action as occasion arose.
Monsieur de Madariaga said that there was appearing in the Disarmament negotiations a similiar inclination to seek for a solution through agreement direct between the industries concerned. This applied particularly to chemical warfare and air warfare.
The SE01ÎETARY-G3EERÀL, after consultation with Monsieur de Madariaga, said that he thought it might he vase to ascertain the probable attitude of the Government of the U.Sd. to the inclusion of the question ox private manufacture in the agenda of the Disarmament Conference.
In reply to a question by Dame lischel Crowdy, the SECIlSTAirr-GElMSTAL said that Chairmen or members of Committees of Spanish or Brazilian nationality must continue to he treated as retaining their positions except in cases where withdrawal had been officially notified:.
Monsieur OSRESCU said that the meeting of representatives of the chief Chalcographie institutions had just been
held at the seat of the League. The idea of the International
3
Committee of Intellectual Co-operation had teen that an exhibition of the engravings producer, by these institutions might be held at the headquarters of the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation in Paris. The meeting had , however, proposed a more ambitious scheme whereby big exhibitions organised and paid for by the institutions concerned should be held simultaneously at id.ris, ^-ome
and, if possible, Madrid. The exhibitions would be held under the aegis of the International Committee of the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation, and the scheme would have eventually to be approved by the directing Committee of the Institute.
6.	Mr. RCCTI1TG said that the Danzig Government had fallen as a result of the Financial Committee *a report.
IIo new Government had yet been formed though there were indications that a Government of the Right might be constituted within a few days.
7.	Mr. BT3KEEB having asked how the Rsscmbly1 s resolution concerning the observation by members of Committees
of the rules for reclaiming expenses should be brought to the notice of the members of Committees, it was decided that a copy of the resolution should be attached to each of the forms filled in by members at the beginning of meetings.

The SiiCri-i TARY~(Lj1^BAL ashed tho meeting to discuss the procedure to be followed. Should tho Assegibly’s Resolutior be circularised to committees, or should each secretary bri it to the notice of his respective committee? As to tho ac to be talon on tho Resolution, would it not be vossibla for committees to prepare a rather longer report and dis ense w printed minutes?
Dame Rachel CROWDY feared that some committees ¡night tale advantage of the Assembly’s Resolution to do without minutes altogether, which would be undesirable from the publicity point of view, moreover, her experience showed that reports would only be lengthened by prolonging the meet of comrittees, which would increase costs. ¡.limites could, mo .ever, a o sn o r u ■ j no d.
M. Si’OPPAUI also thought that sa"; re sc ion of public ninutes and the lengthening of reports would not afford a solution. I'he only way was to give a definite instruction eo the minute-writers to shorten the minutes.

Dr. Gorman vHITM agreed that there must be some means of recording the views of individual members if they wished it, and also that longer reports would mean longer sessions.
Mr. HI-iM could not say whether the minutes of the Transit Commit tee ooitld be profitably shortened, out he could assuie the Secretary-General that the Go.; it tee was always prepared to have short minutes. He thought t eat minutes were necessary, but was it necessary to

The mooting discussed tho provisional Agenda for tho Ib rtÿ.~ third session of tho Council ( Ann ox	)
Cortain changes w or o ma do which Kr.Bmcton was asked to include in a rovicod Ag onda.
Tho fol lending oh sorvat ions arising out of tho Agenda woïo also made :
Item 1. (h) Appointment of two memo or s of tho -Supervisory Commission :
Tho 3 URSi'ARY-GENERA1 said that he thought it would bo host if, as had’boon dono hitherto, tlio two kombors whoso torn of offioo woro coming to an end should bo re-appointod. It was true that tho original intention had boon to have on tho Suporvi-sory Commission a majority of tho nationals of Etat as which woro not noabors of tho Council. With tho now composition of tho
Courseil tho present momboi1 s of tlio Commission woro mostly tlio nationals of 3tctos which wore ambers of tho Council.
On tho whole, ho thought it best that attention should not bo drawn to this fact, as, at any rate for the prosont, it was desirable that some 1 tat os which contributed heavily towards the Loaguo osponsoo should bo represented on the Comisaion. further the original constitution of tho Comaittoo had boon franod on tho assumption that tho Council would itself deal in detail with tho estimates etc. Tlio Council had how over iJLways preferred to leave such matters entirely to tho Assembly.
It ora	Study of tlio legal Position of the States which
did not pay their contributions to the league :
Tho SfiCRC!EiRY-(13HER*L said that, as far as he could soo, the Council might adopt one of the three following methods a) It might sot up a spocial Committo to consider the
quostion;
b)	It might ash tho jurists -ttcchod to tho Council mambors to study it at tho session of tho Council itself;
c)	It might ash that tho l,.gal Section of tlio Socrotariat should make a preliminary report.
Mr.MACKD! 11011 WOOD said that ho would like to have more time to consider the matter. A report by the Secretariat would only bo useful if, in fact, various opinions on tho legal point had boon omprossod which could tlion bo colloctod in a single report.
Mr .HAH TO TJX a shod whether a result of tho Council’s omamination of this quostion might not bo that certain non-paying members would leave tho 1 aguo.
~z~
Tho SEClli)T£RY~Gi5NliRAIi ngrood that this danger oris tod, and that any rqport would therefore have to bo very oarofully worded.
For similar roasons, a certain amount of procrastination in this matter would not bo amiss, and ho tlioroforo hoped that the Sooiotariat would be asked to report as a first stop, this report might be followed later by an examination on the part of the Jurists a ttached to the Monbers of the Council.
Item 4. System of the single transferable Yota and the Principle of proportional representation in connection with the election of the non-permanent Members of the Council:
Tire SECRETARY-GiflnTtAX suggestod that the Political Section find out privately when the manorandum from the Norwegian Govammaa t on which the further study of this question was to be based would be reoeived.
Item 8(a). Disarmament Conference:
The 8EC1 ETARY-GENERAL said that the Council would presumably ask the Preparatory Committee to hasten its work, and also to prepare an agenda for the Conference. Ha hoped it would not at the forthcoming session fix the date of the Conference but would leave that also to the Preparatory Committee for suggestions.
(b) Private Manufacture of Arms:
The SECRETARY-GUN >Elil said that ho had heard privately that the Government of the United States of America hoped that this
t
•»rb^yKnn wauld not bo referred to the Preparatory Committee or placed on thu_mgendrv -or? titajnsin Disarmament Conference.
Item 21. Premanen-t-i.Iano.ates Commission:
(a]	Report on the work of ius l&tbu suasion.
Mr.GILCHRIST said that the Report could hardly be ready.
Veforo tlia 20th Rovoabor at tho earliest.
Tlio SMClfjfnRY-GMIMlRAIi sc id that tho question should ho kept on tho Agenda and a r ep»rt prepared for tho Radnor tour. At tho Council session tho Rapporteur night enquire privately another any Member objoctod tc the immediate consideration of tho Report, and if so, move its adjournment.
It might also ha right to adjourn (b} (List of questions for the annual Reports on territories under 3. and C, Ran dates), as tho chs or vat ions of the rnoro distant Mandatory Mowers could hardly bo rocoivad by Docombor 1st, tho date for which they had boon ashed.
Item £2. Health Committe<a
: sport on the work of its
Oth session:
Dr.BOUDRHMU having observed that tho Council would bo oallod upon to elect sin new members of the Heal th Committee, it was agreed that the Item should bo re-drafted by tho Health Section and HT.Bur:ton so as to provide for those nominations.
The 8BCMMTARY-SHN jR4I said that as the Agon da would probably, owing to tho postponement of some of the more important items, bo finished in a session of throe or four days, he was a little afraid lost some of tho busior Members of the Council might reel that they had come to Geneva unnecessarily. He suggested that with the Agenda might be sont out a list of the Minorities1 Committees which would moot concurrently with tho Council session and tho subjects with which they would deal.

Dame Rachel CROvTDY added in explanation that the enquiry which was to precede the setting-up of a committoo was nut yet sufficiently advanced. moreover, there wore no funds for such a committee as the budget at present only allowed for the expanses which Dr. Hansen or his representative might incur in pursuing: his enquiry ox for printing.

lui . WILdOE Secretary
1* The SECHETAHY-GkKkHAXi said that the preparation oí the reports fot the 45rd Seabion cí the Council was well advanced.
most of the items on the agenda were ox a routine nature though there were some acceptions namely, the question or the Agenda and date of the Disarmament Conference (Item 9), the question or freedom of transport in the Saar (question 20) and possibly the question or the anointment or the chairmen or the Commissions of Investigation .
The o ■- iiimún i qué issued by the Inxormation ¿»action on tiie À ..end a had not stated who would be the ¿resident or the Council, as the Carman ra presentative, whose turn it was to preside, might pral ør to wait until a later session before doing so.
With reference to question 9 "Reduction of armaments", the o^OR -TAitL "**Xf _uAvin xLxXj asked n. nadariaga whether the draft reports had yet gone to k. denes.
k. LíaDaRIAGá said that the necessary memoranda were

ready, but that he t .-Knight that in this as in other difficult questions, the reports should not be drawn up until it was possible to consult soma of the leading members of the Council privately.
■Ihe	agreed that this might bo advisable,
but hopod that the reports would be drawn up at the earliest possible moment as the now members of the Council would probably not wish to discuss a report which had net bean in their hands for at least a day beforehand; in any case the report of Item 8 (Arbitration and bacurity) should be prepared.
With reference to Item 4 (proportional Representation)
M. kANTCUZ explained that he expected the memorandum from the Norwegian Government which was to be circulated to the Council, to be received in about ten days.
2	• fne LiiiCik j1 i'riAV—'.t ~ji'i,i_iA.a. said tnau *.¿3 would be g omp to London on bun day, November 14th; should too sections desire him to discuss certain Questions there ha was prepared to do so .
5. At the request of Arofossor AffClICO, mr . idCJiHiiilOil WOOL explained the purport ox the recant communication from the Persian representative relative to article 16 of the Covenant, professor xlfuilOO suggests-., that a 'paper giving the past history of this and other analogous questions might be prepared for internal use.
4.	Lr. RaJOHoAH said that the Düsseldorf International Health exhibition had sent to the Health Committee, which had had an exhibit there, a latter offering it a gold medal. Acceptance of the medal might create an embarrassing precedent; on the other hand he did not know in what terms to refuse •
&ix . i A: saio tn at tner a	a uanger Oj. xuture x^eagus
exhibits being awarded only second class medals.
3
After some discussion in which it was cade clear that tlio Hxhibition had not teen competitive, it was agreed that the medal might ho accepted; Professor ATTOLICO adding that whenever in future the League made an exhibit it should he pointed out to the exhibition authorities that the league’s exhibit was hors coficours.
5c> Hr. El AH explained the state of the negotiations with regard to the Arad and the Karmarosi railway.
6.	Mr. HIAii said that the Railway Sub-Committee of the
Transit Committee had met and the Sub-Committee for Solegraphic questions was about to moot. Their reports on facilities which might he acoordod to tho League in times of crises should be ready for the meeting of the Committee of the Council on the 1st Pec ember.
M. MADARIAGA said that the Committee of the Council would certainly wish to discuss these reports at its meeting on 1st December but could it reçoive them before the Council?
In reply to the SDC3JTARY-G JIÜRAl, Mr., HIAii explained that in order to save time the reports of the two Sub-Committees would be transmitted to the Council on the authority of tho President of the Transit Committee.
The SDCRjTARY-GDISRAX said that this being so, the President of the Council might also be ashed to authorise the transmission of the reporta to the Committee of the Council at its December
meeting-.
M. MADARIAGA said that he would, in consultation with the Transit Section, write to the President of the Council accordingly^
Prom information given by Hr* HI AH to the meeting
concerning the results of the enquiry which was being made, the „ilChhiil„iL-i/lil,,! concluded that the reports would. give 68-u S cl tisfaction to the Council Committee.
7, H. II.Jjiix.said that several reasons le d to the conclusion that the Preparatory Committee could not sold its final session as early as february.
I'irst, the reports of the bub-Comni trees, which would be voluminous, would not bo ready for distribution until about Christmas. Secondly, sub-Comm is si on 3 would hardly finish before Pebruary a special re. ort which it had been ashed by sub-Commis^ ion to make on the economic cons ecu ences entailed by the aggregate limita cion of civil and military aeronautics, Thirdly there was reason to believe that, at the nec:t cession of the Council, the Japanese representative might ask that special one savours should be made to induce the U.o.b.L. to be represented at the last meeting of the Preparatory Committee grid the Conference.
4ftei some discussion it was agreed that tnough the Secretariat would not be justified in making further representations to the Swiss Government with a view to facilitating che representation of the U.-w.^.h. the uestion v, was of such groat importance that any action which the members of the Council might be able to take towards finding a solution would be welcome«.
8.	Id. iimiiu.IjiSa s,,.id that,according to a resolution adopted oy cxie -assembly ac x gs las g ^essioxi, a conference on the private manufacture of arms should be held before the nent session of the Assembly, either in connection with the general Conference on Disarmament or separately.
5
It was now clear that the. general conference could hardly meet "before 1928* Should a separate conference on the private manufacture of arms therefore he convoked before the assembly's
Session?
She SAÛBASAitï-GBIuIRAli said that as the general conference could not meet before the neat session of the Assembly, every endeavour should be made to give the Assembly satisfaction on the second matter on which it had set its heart, namely, the convocation of a conference on tlio private manufacture of arms before the session. She Government of the United States of America was most unwilling to see the ouestion of private manufacture treated at the general conference but, in view of a statement rca,de by its representative at the conference on the traffic in Arms, to tiio effeot that the convention on the Sreffic should later be sup-
plemerited by a convention on private manufacture, he thought that the emitted States Government would rind it o.ifricult to reruse an invitation to a special conference on private manufacture.
Li. MADARIAGA observed that though the non-mamfecturing powers dosired that the conference on private manufacture should meet, the manufacturing powers did not desire it.
Pro^essor AS SCI IOC wondered whether the difficulties which the conference on the private manufacture might encounter might not prejudice the success of the general conference.
She SAORASARr-G'AirlEAl thought that this would not necessarily be the case; the conference on private manufacture would probably arrive at an agreement though not necessarily of a far reaching kind. Before it could be convoked certain negotiations would be neoessary, for instance, some countries which objected to the
6*
separation of the cuestión fren tie ¿-ano-r&i quasticn of disarmament would have to bo persuaded. In any case it seemed to him that the conference on private m&nufacture should meet.
This being so, conferences might begin in 13 27 on approximately the following dates:
Private manufacture of arias Juno 15th Oiraolo Scheme	July 15th
economic Conference	October 15th
9.	M* Li¿DAEIAG¿ said that from -lay to November the various disarmament committees had held S53 sittings, that within ono day (9 a»m. on Priday 5th November to 4 p.m. on Saturday), 130,400 sheets of paper had been roneod and 361 stencils cut. Prom May 17th to ITovember 5th the numbers of stencils cut and of sheets of paper issued

were respectively 17.9C0 and 3.7C5r8£5,.

The SEC RE TAR Y -G EIIERmL , referring to Mr #PeltTs n® mo random (Annex 1), which suggested that the Economic Conference should he held in ¿just er dam) said that the administrative and financial aspect of the question should he carefully considered. It would ho most awkward for Committees meeting at Geneva, while the
Economic Conference met elsewhere, to work with the depleted staff. Moreover, the extra staff required for a meeting outside Geneva would cost more, as it would not he possible, as her©, to call on staff for a half day or an hour or two. Everyone ’■Quid have tc he engaged for full time.
Perhaps the most important consideration of all was the effect which the decision taken mi^ht have on the chances

sentation of the
Union of Socialist Soviet Republics
at the Disarmament 0onference.
Sir .»rthur S..L1MR said that tho reasons for and against holding a Conference at Amsterdam seemed to him to be nicely balanced» 2ho reasons for he need not repeat, as LircC?elt had tiven them,.
The organisation of the Conference would be much moro difficult at msfcordam than at Geneva» Moreover, the additional expanse v, ould to cons iderabio, though it was o spec too1 that the Dutch Government naSo a special contribution towards it0 Ho did, ho' over, value highly the advantagoe of holding- a conference in suitable buildings ’.vhoro, for instance, three cr four Committees of about 100 members oach could meet concurrentlyc
Professor nTTGLlOO said that in his opinion there could be only one reason for holding the meeting at .‘jesterdam,namely, that accommodation could not be had at Geneva» If the meeting was hold outside Geneva, the loaguers work at Geneva would practically stop ¿or the time being» Ha was net convinced by the argument that business men would more readily fellow a conference at ¿msterdam» lest of them would net understand the language of the country,
Li„LLiuhiELjG,. said that if it sc chanced that mootings of ths Jb anomic Conference and of the preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference overlapped, and the former was held outsida Genova, the material arrangements would break down.
fit was agreed incidentally that the best date for the ¡ting of tho Preparatory Committee would be the 18th March).
~culd

Dame Rachel CR0W1Y said that two oi her committees would be meeting successively from the 25th of April tr ahcub the 10th cf May,
Mr. McKIIilTOIi WOOD said that the meeting cf the Ccnmiittee on the Co-ordination of International Law wculd he held in March.
M. COMERT thought that it was good for propaganda purposes to hold meetings outside Geneva from time to time, and personally he was in favour cf holding the Economic Conference at Amsterdam. However, he recognised that the arguments against this course were weighty, and he added that the journalists who came to League meetings were opposed to meetings outside Geneva.
Mr. .TACTCTiTTT said that he wculd like to Enow exactly hc^ much money the Dutch Government wculd contribute in aid cf the Conference before giving an opinion on the financial aspect.
M. MAMCUX thought that the chief argument for Amsterdam was the possibility club a meeting there would interest more business men. On the whole, the arguments against seemed to him to prevail.
M. COLLAR could see no argument in favour of Amsterdam except those adduced by Mr. Pelt, arid none of these convinced him. The argument that it was wise to demonstrate the activity of the League in various countries was cf little value when applied to Holland, which was the seat of the Permanent Court
-4-
of International Justice. The Assembly had declared itself more than once in favour of holding all League meetings in Geneva, and whatever exceptions might be allowed, a conference as important as the Economic Conference, which vnuld be the source of much League work for years to come, was not one of then.
11. BOlhiET said that a Conference in Geneva would be shorter, which was an advantage.
Lame Rachel CROYDY and II, CATASTIITI were for holding the Conference in Geneva: Dr. EYRCES also, on the ground that such action was less than the contrary, likely to- spoil the chances of Russian representation at the Disarmament Conference,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that political and administrative, and financial reasons militated against Amsterdam. If it was possible to find proper accommodation for the Conference in Geneva, the question was	*
therefore settled: if it were not, the question
might be	ro-opened,	it beiii;	g understood that	the	
disadvant	ages of he	Iding th	e Conference away	from	Geneva
would be	outweighed	only by	a high degree of	unsuitability	
in the accommodation available in Geneva,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL referring to the time to be allowed in asking for replies to Circular Letters (Annex c) said that the last sentence of the memorandum
5
circulated contained an er.;or, as the observations of Governments on the Leport of the Preiaratory Committee of the Economic Conference would not he Called fox.
It was a fact, as the memorandum showed, that the time required for replies from distant countries to reach Geneva was not always tahen fully into account in drafting requests for ouch replies. moreover,, it was sometimes forgotten that a Circular Letter might only be despatched some three weeks after the first draft suggesting the date had been made. The present position was apt to he somewhat irritating to the more distant ..embers of the .ueague, and he felt that, as a rule, the governing consideration in fixing a date for a reply should be the time required for a reply from the most distant Lenders to reach Geneva.
Dame Lachel CLGVQY Said that, for her Committees, different dates were set for the receipt of replies from European and extra-European j .embers of the Lea rue, both as regards annual reports and answers to questionnaires.
Sir Arthur SALl'ln said that, in certain urgent cases where, moreover, communication by cable would ue too costly, it would be necessary to publish the replies first received, and publish those received later in a supplementary document. The distant countries might, in sunk cases, be informed that this course would be adopted..

The Meeting considered the question of the approval of the Council Agenda by the dcting-President [mnex 3 j .
Sir „rthur 3LLTE3. said that there has a fourth possible eourse, additional to the three, outlined in the memorandum v hich had been circulated, namely, that
in the intervals between Council sessions, it should be
7
the in-corning President who would be regarded as Acting-President or the. Council £ or all purpos es *
'The 3dC*idIAHY-G 1! rhih did not lilts this idea, as most ox the w or it which the Acting-President -as required to tame between sessions was connected with the last rather tban vi i th the c an ing Sess ion.
Professor ATTOuICO preferred Course (3).,
M. CO 13.UI wanted no change» The present systera seemed to him lo ioal, because the agenda, as approved by the Acting-President ox the Council, was -iter all provisional, ard became final only when ado ted by the Council»
Me CCLihAT .ondered whether the Council ni ;ht not appoint at each session the President of its no::t session, who would assist the Act ini-President ./hen required.

II E X I.
A few vie oka ago, at my return from a mission to the Hague I mentioned in conversation with you that the municipal government of Amsterdam was considering the possibility of inviting tho Economic Conference to meet in that city. Last week I was privately informed that the municipality has come to a definite decision in this matter, and that negotiations are going on botwsen Amsterdam and the Hague on the subject. I do not yet know what is going to be tho attitude- of the Hogue authorities, but I have some reason to believe that it will be a favourable one.
Under those circumstances the two Dutch members of the Preparatory Committee fof the Economic Conference, Lir. ZrOller and.
Mr. Oudegeest, thought wise to enquire in a discrete way among the members of this Committee whether a Dutch initiative of the kind mentioned abevo would eventually meet with sympathy. Their general impression was, that those members cx tho Committee who are since several years in the habit of coming to Geneva, although not formulating any concrete objection against Amsterdam, rather prefer to have tho conference at the seat of the League than meeting elsewhere. .Several other member >, however, especially those whoso membership of the Preparatory Committee brought thorn for the first time to G-aneva, rather thought that it might be a good idea to have the Economic Conference in a big: economic centre liko Amsterdam. At the same time I asked fer the opinion of a few friends in the Secretariat, and as a whole I rather found them willing to consider favourably an eventual Dutch invitation.
As far as my two countrymen and I myself could gather, the
-11-
arguments of those ".'ho would loch favourably upon Amsterdam as meeting place for the economic conference arc the following:
1) They like the idea to have this conferones in « city liko Amstordam, which represents one of tho world’s important shipping trading and banking centres; with easy and direct telegraph and telephone communicat ions with the principal capitals of Europe. They drew attention to the fact that Amsterdam can be reached in a few hours by aeroplane from London, Paris, n£le, Vienna, Berlin and the Scandinavian countries, and that it is linked up directly by telephone with a big wireless station covering not only Europe but also the American continent and the Ear East.
Several members of tho Committee expressed the opinion that this was net only important for tho success of the Conference, but also from the point of view of many businessmen who would like to assist, but who would lino at the same t ime to remain in easy communication with their affairs. Erom the point of view of tho Conference they apparently wore of the opinion that tho argument mentioned above had a double effect:
a) the atmosphere of a city like Amsterdam might favourably influence the Conference;
b) having the Conference in Amsterdam, would usefully meet the objection of many critics, who always pretend that tho results achieved in Genova, specially in the economic field, risk to be blown to pieces as soon as they got into touch with reality.
8) Another advantage of having tho Conference outside Gonevc would 'in the opinion of the people consulted give it a standing of its own, thus marking it as a great event in the economic
records of the world. It was pointod out that this consideration had proved to bo of special value in tho c-so of the Brussels
ri	?T -r, -v-rj-j o o "! o
xuu j3iu.Q0Ua.ij
T'inanci-1 Conference. "Pho” 3russois Conference moan b t body tho bo¿Tinning Cx financial reconstruction. "The*’ Amsterdam Conference would moan in th<s ruinro the beginning ox a new dcnnlop-msnt in the economic area, while in the cane of the conference being 11010 in Ionova it would only bo one out of a long list.
3} Considering that the participating countries will be invited to send a delegation of five men, that owing to tho intric&tQ and complicated character ox economic problems, the number of exports per delegation will piob&oly bo a fairly considerable one, it seems justified to expect the Conference to bo bigger than an ordinary assembly. Kow the Sallo de la Reformation gives hardly sufficient space for an .assembly, and the only <. ther big suitable meeting-ha 11 in Genova, tho Bâtiment Sleet oral, apart from the ¿hot that it has a very bad acoustic, has been reserved already for the labour Conference, which is going to bo opened on lhy 37th, and which necessitates a fortnight beforehand extensive modifications of the building. To this is to be added
that tho Committees of the Soononic Conference will also bo bigger
than those of tho Assembly, as very probably every delegate will take one or more exports with him to tho Committee meetings.
Under these circumstances tho question arises whether tho Conference can bo comfortably housed in Geneva. In Amsterdam tn tho contrary wo would probably have the choice between two suitable buildings, largo enough to give shelter to tho full conferonco, to tho committee mootings and to the secretariat.
It would bo necessary of course tc gather detailed particulars about these buildings on the spot.
To certain members of the Preparatory Committee and to a few colleagues in tho Secretariat the fact that u Russian Delegs-
-lo-
tion might officially or unofficially coma to Amsterdam while they would not oono to Geneva, seamed to ho an argument in favour of Amsterdam, but opinions on this point wore not unanimous. The
Same	Call be-	K aid -	1 on j Am e r x c an	participation

Genova would		male o	it easier for	the American
as curt..in people on for once out sic o
an invitation; other people on the contrary expressed the view that this would not o ;• of any influence rhstovc-r.
Tho main objection which was formulated against Amsterdam was the e tho 3e.crotari-jt, fhr from its haadiuar tors, would work, under lesa favourable circumstances than in Geneva. This is of course a point which other people in tho secretariat, with more experience of its general ’sorbing, can judgo better than I. fly personal impression is, hcv/ovor, t 11 e>. uii :J 0 Oil o olidation of the Secretariat organisation and its strong sunso of duty soems to me sufficient guarantee that it would be e-sy to overcome eventual handicaps which might result from holding tho Con foronce outside Geneva.
mother objection might be that the cost of the Ccnforanoo outside Geneva is considerably higher thmi that of the Conference hold at the sent of tho League, but il the Dutch Government in-vitos tho Oonforonco to come to Amsterdam this difficulty would probably bo mot by all ofior to pa^ for tAio surplus costs.

1I0T1 BY TEE SBC YE TAR Y- GEEERAL »
It has occurred to ne for some tine past that, although the system of sending the Council Agenda to the Acting President of the Council for approval has up to now worked comparatively well, it is not really logical, and might at some future time lead to difficulties«
To my mind, the proper procedure would he that the Agenda should ho approved hy the member of the Council who is to act as President at the nent meeting.
There seem to be three different courses possible
1)	The continuance of the present system;
2)	That all questions relating to work arising out of the past session should he considered hy the Acting President hut questions relating to the
nent session hy the President designate.
(The disadvantage of this system is that we are not always certain who the nent President will he),
3)	That the out-going President should preside over the opening meeting of the nent Council till such-time as the Agenda had been adopted, and that ' e
should then give place to the new President.
(This would avoid the disadvantage attached to (2) and it would give somewhat more formality to the installation of the new President).
At the same tine* it does not seen altogether consequent that
the Agenda should he approved en bloc by one President, and
that the subjects should then he discussed in detail under
the Presidency of another member of the Council.
I realise that, as the two letter courses to which I
have referred present certain difficulties, it may he wiser
to leave matters as they no^ stand.
I think, however, that we might well discuss the
natter at a future Directors Lee ting; I circul-te this note
for that purpose.

Fnr the Directors 5 Meeting:
The Question has "been raised as to whether it is possible or desirable to lay dorm a general rule to the effect that in all eases where (a) an3r official person,or (b) any private person cones to Geneva on the convocation of the Secretariat for work connected with the league, his Government should he infomed of the fact by the Secretariat. I propose to appoint a snail Conn.ittee to consider and report on this question, after taking into consideration the various ways in which such cases normally occur, e„go, appointments in the Secretariat, visits of unofficial experts, meetings of cub-Committees whether consisting of officials or otherwise, etc. etc.

Ur* BUMIOW was asked to prepare a revised programme embodying the changes made at the meeting.
M. IL'JITOUZ said that the Norwegian Report on Proportional'Representation had arrived o The Rapporteur would ask the Council to send this Report to the Governments for their consideration. The Council would presumably be in a position to examine the views of Governments at its June beosion.
In reply to I.L COPBAH, the SSCRE mRYeGEMRAl said that he thought there was no need to press the work of the Minorities Committees so that they should he finished on Tuesday.
2.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought that
probably the Belgian Representative would preside at the forthcoming session of the Council. However, should enquiries he made to the secretariat, it would he right to answer that it was to he assumed for the present that the German Representative

3.	The SEGEETrh.rY--GSlTM^L said that the Dutch Representative felt that his Government had been placed in the position in which it would feel hound to invite the Council to appoint Amsterdam as the place for the Economic Conference. This was an embarrassing situation as, for the reasons given at the previous meeting, the Conference w cu Id probably be held at Geneva.
Professor ATTOLIC 0 said that, if the offer was made, it would also be embarrassing for the other Members of the Council to refuse.
It was agreed that whatever happened should be at a private meeting.

Present: The SECRETARY-GENERAL

CuLiilNGS
BOUDREAU
V7ILSON (Secretary)
The Nesting considered the Note which had been circulated regarding the replies to be sent to communications of an inflammatory nature (Annex 1).
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that to the three possible courses of action set forth in the Note, a fourth might be added, namely, that the receipt of communications to the League should be immediately acknowledged by the Registrar in the simplest possible form, e.g., a printed note saying "The registrar of the Secretariat of the League of dations is instructed to acknowledge the receipt of the communication dated ....... from ....
Further replies would naturally be sent later to such communications as called for them.
Professor ATTCLICC thought that a distinction should be made between communications which, had they been presented by
2
t i
a competent authority, might have been considered to the field of the League's work, and those which related to natters wholly outside the competence of the League. To the first it was proper to reply, as was usually done, to the effect that League action could not be initiated by private individuals. To the second, no reply at all should be sent.
b. C0L3A" said that the Minorities Section had constantly to consider the form of replies to be sent to communications.
These varied according to the particular case, and if the communication cane, for instance, from a body known to be revolutionary, nothing more than the briefest third person acknowledgment was sent. As far as the minorities Section was concerned, he hoped that no rules which night affect its present practice would be laid down. On the general question, he agreed with Professor Attolico as to the difference which should be made in the replies to the two kinds of communications, but for the second, thought that a Registrar's acknowledgment should be used.
The	STCRTTAR
here	were any
my coununica lunatics) to which no reply at a Attolico had explained that, in cations. He, the Secretary-Gene
that	some ackn	owledgment	should
and	therefore	liked the	idea of
the	Registrar.		
said that the point at issue was tions (apart fro . letters from 11 should be sent. Professor his view, there were such conmuni-ral, on the other hand, would prefer be sent to every co .municat ion, the preliminary acknowledgment by
Sir Arthur SALTTR thought that the system of acknow lodgment by the Registry would be very satisfactory, provided it did not lead to delay and was practised for all letters addressed officially to the Secretary-General.
3
Professor ATTOLICO said that the question of expense would have to be considered. If a printed letter or postcard was sent by the Registry in the first place, another reply would, in most cases, be sent later. This would mean double postage.
♦
These were points to consider with the Treasury.
The DEPUTY-SECRETARY-C-ENEEAL approved the proposal for Registry acknowledgment, but thought that such acknowledgment should not be sent in reply to official letters from governments or their representatives.
11. C0L3AN and K. CAT AST INI pointed out the difficulties which might arise if replies sent to correspondents reproduced always the titles claimed by the correspondents themselves. They therefore wished to see before dispatch all replies sent to letter concerning their Sections.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that there was no need for the Registry to give more than the name of the correspondent in the address used in the reply.
Professor ATTOLICO was still of opinion that there might be cases in which it was in the interest of the League that no reply at all should be sent. He was however willing to accept the principle of a general form of acknowledgment from the negistr
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that a Committee might

The Registrar,
A member of Ur. Cobban’s Section to be named by Hr. Colban. and Hr. Huston.

The meeting considered the Note which had been circulated regarding the question of Members of the Secretariat addressing public Meetings. (Annex II).
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Note should perhaps have made an exception for those members of the Information Section whose work it was to follow the activities of the League in general. They should be allowed also to speak of the work of the League in general.
Dame Rachel CROWDY thought that some regulation on public speaking by members of the Secretariat was necessary. The time had passed when audiences v/ished to hear generalities about the League, and it was most unfortunate if, as sometimes happened, members of the Secretariat spoke about a given League subject, knowing less of it than many members of the audience. If it was necessary that addresses should be given by officials other than the members of the Secretariat who specialised in the subject of the address, the Section concerned should at any rate be consulted by the speaker beforehand, so that the information given should be up-to-date.
M. : .«XT CUX agreed that speakers should feel it incumbent upon them to obtain the latest information, but felt that it was not practicable to lay down that only specialists on a given subject should address meetings on that subject. The members of the Information Section could not be expected to speak only about generalities.
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that there were two considerations which limited the choice of speakers, (1) the danger of indiscreet statements being made. With regard to this point, he agreed that each member of the Secretariat who addressed a public meeting should te made to feel his responsibility,
5
and should also provide himself with the latest information. (2) The second consideration was that of expense and convenience. A specialist was not always available to address a meeting, and the meeting would nevertheless be happy to hear some other well-informed member of the Secretariat. Ke hoped no rules would be laid down, as rules would not make the naturally indiscreet person discreet. Everything depended on the common sense and sense of responsibility of the Secretariat, and these could only be improved by suitable action, if and when they should be found to be dangerously lacking in a given case.
He took this opportunity to state that , in his view, it was not the function of the Information Section to decide what publicity should be given on some subject (e.g. Austria), but to help the Section concerned to get such publicity as the Section thought expedient, and of course the Information Section had the general function of keeping the work of the League as a whole before the public.
Dame Rachel CROWDY said that she could call to mind at least four cases where addresses had been given by members of the Secretariat which had contained either indiscretions on political subjects, or had given false information on technical subject s.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that a distinction should be made between selected and ordinary audiences. When an audience consisted of people well-informed on a particular League subject and desirous of hearing of the work of the League in that domain in detail, obviously it was preferable that one of the specialists in the Secretariat on that subject should speak; but many meetings consisted of the general public which wished to know of the progress of the work of the League as a whole. Such audiences the members
6
of the Information Section were well qualified to address, it being understood that they should verify their information beforehand.
The DEPUTY-SECRETARY—GENERAL agreed with this view and added that in countries where little was known of the League, e.g., in distant countries, it was inevitable that addresses should usually deal with the work of the League as a whole, and should be given by any qualified members of the Secretariat who happened to be there.
L.	COLLAR thought the discussion showed the need for reducing the amount of public speaking done by members of the Secretariat. Should not the authority of the Secretary—General be obtained before any public speaking by a member of the Secretariat was made ?
II. de MADARIAGA suggested that the right principle was that a member of the Secretariat should speak only on the work of his own Section, or on the work of the League in general. If he was likely to deal in any detail with the work of a Section not his own, he should consult that Section beforehand.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he did not propose to issue a general instruction to the Staff. He would prefer that each Director, in such a way as he felt best, should make clear to the members of his Section that, owing to the growing importance of the work of the League and the feeling which some of the questions dealt with by the League aroused, it behoved ail members of the Secretariat to realise their responsibility as officials cf the League in any statements that they might make to public audiences. YTherever they felt any doubt as to the

wisdom of making a speech to a certain audience or discussing
certain subjects, they should consult their administrative superior.
de ¡"ADARIAGA asked whether it was possible to exten the same warning to organisations affiliated to the Secretariat.

RAL said that he was not competent to
of a speech damaging to the League

happened, he would prefer to take no action.
hr. CUhhlkGS 'was sure that members of the Information Section were not anxious to speak at length on the technical work of the League, and agreed that the Technical Sections of the Secretariat concerned should always be consulted before information
in a speech, kcreover, d always be informed of ~nv speeches which were made by other members of the Secretariat.

Invitations to Conferences (annex III'
I
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought it would be a great improvement if the action to be taken when invitations were received was centralised in one Section, which should clearl; be the Information Section. The Section could th culate for the information of the Secretariat, a list of invitions received and the action which was being taken with regard to them. An essential condition for the success"

was, of course, that no 1-11110 should be lost by the information Section in dealing with these invitations, and especially in consulting the other Sections concerned.
if. HAAS saw some difficulty in the fact that some invitations were not addressed to the Secretariat, but to League committees.
H. COLEAN said, with reference to the last paragraph of the Note, that it would be better if, in the case of invitations concerning Sections other than the Information Section, the Information Section should not reply itself, but send the file on to the Section concerned.
It was agreed that this change should be made, and L. Haas said that it met his difficult;/.
It was accordingly decided that, in future, all official invitations should be sent by the Registry in the first place to the Information Section, If the invitations concerned another Section of the Secretariat, the Information Section would immediately send the file for action to the Section concerned, taking the necessary action itself on the remainder. Further, the Information Section would distribute weekly a list of invitations received and the action which had so far been decided upon.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the recent session of the Council showed how useful it was not to crowd the work too much, and above all, to have only one Council meeting a day, preferably in the afternoon.
Frofessor ATTOLICQ agreed generally, though he thought an afternoon meeting of four hours was a heavy burden to any members of the Council who were not in good health.
IfADARIAGA
- q
II. de IfADARIAGA said that a Rapporteur for certain subjects on the Council’s agenda had, before authorising the distribution of his report, asked for comments on it from three or four members of the Council. This practice was embarrassing for the Secretariat, as it delayed the distribution, and it was unfair to the excluded members of the Council. Should not therefore one of the following two systems be followed:
1)	that	the Rapporteur	sho	uld take	the	full responsibility
hi s	report	and show it to	no	other mem	her	before distribution,
2)	that	he should have	it	distribut	ed a	s a draft report
at a private meeting of the Council, where it could be discussed and later distributed as the report proper.
The DEPUTY-SECRETARY-GENERAL agreed that it was undesirable if the practice of Rapporteurs led to unequal treatment of all the members of the Council. It should be remembered however that the responsibility of the Secretariat ended when the draft report was given to the Rapporteur, and begun again only
when the	Rapporteur	gave it back to the	Secreta	.riat f	or	circula-
tion. t:	he essential	point was that the	report	should	be	di stribut
ed to me:	mbers of the	Council at least 24	: hours	before	it	was
discussed.
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that it could not be finally laid down that 24 hours should elapse between the issue of a report and its discussion. So long an interval was not always necessary, for instance when reports were issued after long discussion by, and approval in, a technical committee.
The SECRETARY—GENERAL said that they were all agreed on the principle that reports should be issued as long as possible before they were to be discussed. It was also desirable that
10
members of the Council should be treated equally, but it would
sometimes happen, as at the recent session, that a few members
of the Council could rightly be considered to be specially
perhaps
interested in a given question . In such cases it was/inevitable that the Rapporteur should consult these members.
Lr de i.'ADARIAGA asked whether the Secretariat could give to a member of the Council on request a copy of the draft report which had been handed to the Rapporteur before its approve
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Secretariat could say that the draft report was in the hands of the Rapporteur, and that only the Rapporteur himself could decide whether it could be shown to any other member of the Council.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the strategy of the foes of the League was now to make it appear that the League was divided into two parties: the dominant party of the Great Powers and the down-trodden party of the Small. To his mind this prsten was a travesty of the facts, though perhaps a certain colour of plausibility was lent to it by the proceedings during the last Council, some of which did, for well-known reasons, fell within the sole competence of certain powers.
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that the importance of this charge was such as to make it necessary to avoid even the appear ance of evil in the future. Perhaps it would be better if dis--cussions affecting only a few of the Great Powers should not be held while the Council was in session, but between sessions.
There was general agreement that this course would lead to the more important statesmen not coming to Geneva, and that the League would lose, rather than gain, by following it.
il
Reverting to the subject of Rapporteur, Sir Arthur SALTER drew attention to the inconvenience of changing the Rapporteur at the last moment.
IT. de LADARIAC-A thought that the last Council had shown the necessity for having rehearsals Of almost every important natter before public discussions.
M.	de MADARIAGA asked that the Meeting should discuss either then or later the question of the prompt payment of the expenses of the members of expert committees.
which the Directors might have to make or be addressed in the first instanc Attolico and the Treasurer.

I should like the Directors' Idee ting to consider at an early date the question of members of the secretariat addressing public meetings. .¿part from this general question, I would like special attention to he given to the point whether, and, if so, to what enter.t, members «x the Secretariat should speak of the work of the league as a whole, instead of that part of i t with which they themselves are specially acquainted.
Although, of course, there are a not inconsiderable number of cases in which members of the Secretariat v/ould be ca gable of speaking on subjects primarily dealt with by Sections other than their own - and this of course applier in a particular degree to the Information Section - it is at
least safe to lay down that a member of the Secretariat ought not to speak about aspects- ex the League's work or. which he
does not feel himself to be thoroughly informed.

There is the
15
further point that such audiences usually like to be allowed to ask questions on all League affairs. These last observations apply with special force to countries which are.
visited by members of the Secretariat only at long intervals.
In such countries it is perhaps inevitable that members cf the Secretariat invited to speak should describe the work of the League as a whole.
1.1 y own feeling is that, apart from exceptional
cases, such as when the cora try visited has very rare opportunities of hearing first-hand information about the
League or when the person who is asked to speak happens to
be. particularly competent to deal with the most important questions of the moment, members ox the .Secretariat should
confine their addresses to audiences of a special character which meet for the purpose of listening to an ai dress on the particular subject which the member in question is specially c ompetent to handle e
This of course does not bear on the case of addresses given to bummer Schools and the like where the audiences get- a proper picture of the activités of the
league as a whole through listening to a large number of addresses on various aspects of it.

I should like to consider ut a Directors1 Meeting the question whether it is possible to impr eve on present procedure in regard to invitations received by the Secretariat to send representatives to international congresses of various rinds.
Such invitations are at present passed cn by the Registry according to their character either to the International Bureaux Section or to the Information Section or to a particular Section whoso work has special affinity with the cbj'cot of the Conference»
The Section receiving the invitation does, no doubt, in most cases consult any other Section which may bo interested, but oases have occurred when such consultation has not tbken place.
It has been suggested to me that it is desirable to try and avoid the recurrence of such oases and further to have one Section in the Secretariat which keeps a general view of the invitations received and the action taken. If this is sc, it seems doer that the Section chosen for the purpose should be the Information Seoticn.
^ possible arrangement, therefore, would be that all official invitations should be sent by the Registry in the first place to the Information Section, which would submit a draft reply to mo aftor consulting all the Sections concerned. arrangements will, of course, have to bo made in the Section for answers to be sent promptly to all invi tat ions and for a complete list to be kept regularly up-to-date of invitations received and the action t.aken on them.

Invitations to such Congresses received by individual members of the Secretariat would be referred by such member in the first place to the Information Section,

Mr. BUXTON was asked to prepare a revised programme embodying the changes made at the meeting.
M. IL'JTTOUX said that the Norwegian Report on Proportional Representation had arrived. The Rapporteur would ask the Council to send this Report to the Governments for their consideration. The Council would presumably be in a position to examine the views of Governments at its June Session.
In reply to H. COP BLN, the SSCRE JKRY& GENERAL said that he thought there was no need to press the work of the Minorities Committees so that they should be finished on Tuesday.

MISSION OP PR. RAJCHMAN 111 THE PAR EAST.
IIOTE BY THE SEOAET/iRY-GEUERAL.
Pr . Ranchman’s report gives a most vivid account ®f his activities and impressions during his stay in the Par East. It is of extreme interest heth from the technical and from the political point of view. I can only admire the manner in which he has clarified all that he saw and heard during his visit to the Par East, I feel sure that the Under Secretaries and Pirectors will much appreciate reading it.
1.	Dr. Rajchman draws attention to the desirability that there should be a Japanese and a Chinese member on the Committee of Intellectual Cc-operation. I fully share his opinion, and hope that it may be possible to arrange for this at an early date.
2.	Ho suggests that there should be some special study for the settlement of disputes in the Par East.
I should have no objection to such a. study being made but in my view the Covenant itself affords really a sufficient basis to cover any special case which may arise, and has the advantage of elasticity so that it can.be shaped to particular circumstances.

The GECBSTAEY-GËITE5AL.
It is my intention to prepare as soon as possible, for submission to the Health Committee, a complete and fully documented report on the results of my mission in the Par East. as, howler, it will be some time before this report can be finished, and as in any case it will be largely technical in character, I thought that you xvould wish me to give you forthwith some general account of my journey. Moreover, though we had neither the time not ’the mandate to conduct any general enquiry into the relations of Japan or China with the League, I was brought into contact, through the courtesy of our hosts, with so many men of such different points of view that I could not fail to receive certain impressions of the attitude of leading Japanese and Chinese t* the League and other matters not within the scope of my immediate business. These I record for what they are worth, fully oonscious that they are necessarily, firom the hurried nature of my visit, sketchy and superficial»
You will recall that the chief objects of the mission were:-
(1)	To taka advantage of the invitation of the Japanese Government to attend the Interchange of Public Health Officers organised by that Government under cur auspices to enquire into the means of affecting closer collaboration between the League and the Japanese Government in health matters;
(2)	To take the oxopor tunity, should it present itself, of discussing with the Chinese Health Authorities the advisability of requesting the Health Organisation to complete the enquiry into Port Health conditions in the Par Last, begun

Arrive and depart on the same day indicate that a stay of some hours was made.
At the Chinese frontier station (Mandchotili) the Chinese text of our League "Lettres de Mission” saved us a Customs examination which would otherwise prolahly have "been required.
At Mandchouli there is a laboratory ox the Manchurian Plague Prevention Service, which I inspected. At Harbin I saw the Headquarters of the Service.
At Changchun we entered the sphere of the South Manchurian Railway, and were met by its P.M.O., a former Japanese member of the Health Section, who had come from Dairen for the purpose. My conversations with the Japanese Public Health Authorities thus began the moment we entered the Japanese sphere of influence.
Becoming rapidly accustomed to being met at the chief stations by the civil .medical and police authorities, we went straight on via Mukden, Peijo, Pusan and Shimoneseki to Osaka, where we first came into touch with the members of the Interchange
We followed the programme of the Interchange at Osaka, Kobe, ITara and Kyoto, and then, together with Dr* Uchino, Chief of the Sanitary Bureau at the Ministry of the Interior and former member of the League Health Committee, we went to Tokyo, where it was at last possible to engage on the more immediate business of our mission.
Cazeneuve , the
V/e r'ere joined at Osaka by Dr H, representative of the Health Section in ’'osco'v since 1924, who, at the request of the Soviet Health authorities, collaborated an th a Russian Plague expedition to Eastern Siberia from August to October 1925, ’"/hen he visited, together -/ith the Russian Chief of the expedition and one cf the Russian members of the Japanese Interchange, the Chinese and Japanese ^nti-plague centres in Manchuria, and proceeded to Tokyo for the beginning cf the Interchange, He returned with. us to Europe, the period for which he was seconded for service terminating on February 1st,
His collaboration proved very useful, particularly in the laborious discussions on the Sanitary Convention with the Japanese authorities. His experience on Plague was most valuable in the preparation of the discussions at the Singapore Gonfere nee ,
The members of the Interchange, having concluded their tour in Japan proper, returned to Tokyo for a conference and exchange of v lews with the Japanese Public Health Authorities, which opened under the presidency of the Minister for Home Iffairs on Hovender 19th 1925,
if ter the Conference the members of the Interchange proceeded, via Jei;jo and Mukden, to Dairen where the members of the Secretariat, having followed them at a few days interval by the same route, joined them for a, final conference with the medical authorities of the Kwantung Leased Territory .and the South 1. anchor ian Railway, which began on December We left Dairen for Peking on December 5th,

Indir , Federated Sit ir., the Philippine Nov Zealand, few exceptions, well of tho countries e organisation* of
tho tour by tho Japanese Cover nun nt oxooodod all possible expectations and indeed tho Interchange group was given a welcome which, in other parts of the world, is seldom accorded to the higher officials of State and Ambassadors, The Japanese Authorities wore anxious to present to their guests as many aspects as possible of Japanese life, in the belief that public health activities cannot be ’well understood without a knowledge of their background. It was a succession of banquets,visits, recaptions., inspections etc, In our European and Americi n Interchanges rn.ore oooortuniities are given for the detailed study of selected sanitary institutions, but I think that generally the group has derived a very great profit indeed from, tho study tour, not without interest for the Japanese public Health Service them.solves. I found here, as before in other countrios, that the organisation of the Interchange give3 the nation?. 1 administration an opportunity of surveying their own position and was an impetus for reform and development.
The basis of cC1 public health work is accurate registration of births and deuthn and of the m.0voir, ant of popula tion. In no country of the world is the registration Of vital statistics as complete us it is in Japan. Public Health activities in Japan are singularly facilitated by the high standard of education throughout tho country, and finally by the exceptional downlines of the people. There is certainly no other nation in the world where tho habit of taking a hot b-th every evening is practically universal., finally the Japanese n- tion is well disciplined and
-6-
follows the directions of those in authority. The results achieved during the last 40 years are truly remsrkab 1 e. The medical schools and institutions have reached the European and best American standards and indeed have surpassed their, in certain specific directions. The number of ir.edical officers engaged on research at the various institutes is the envy of every European and American. The Public Health Service is composed of a very large staff of well-qualified young and zealous officers.
2.	My report to the üealth Committee will show how high is the
sanitary standard of Japan-higher on the whole than that of one or two Great Powers in Europe.
4.	But in spite of all the amazing progress accom.plishod, the
general death rate is still ruch above the standard which should be expected of Japan, while mortality from tuberculosis, typhoid fever and infant mortality is unusually high. A very great effort is being made for improvement. Tho facts of the situation were, at the request of the Japanese Health Authorities, freely commented upon during the final Interchange conference.Japenese medical science has developed under the influence of German medicine of the early bacteriological epoch and it is only a few yoars ago that public health conceived a social medicine has begun making rapid progress in the country.
It is tho Public Health Service of Korea and of the South Manchurian Railway Co. which gives illustration as to what the younger generation of Japanese medical officers are capable of whon given a free hand and provided with adequate funds. The public health and medical centre at Keijo, under the very distinguished direction of Professor Shiga, one of the leaders of the world's bacteriojdgy will serve as an example to any oountry in regard to achievements and applied medical science.
Th,e South Manchurian Railway Co. has set up, and is maintaining,
£wo medical faculties, a number of first-class hygienic institutions and have just completed in Dairen the building
- 7 -
of one »f the m*st ccmplete and luxurious hospitals to Isa seen anywhere. Its anti-epidemic service is very alart and efficient and has at his disposal an annual appropriation of one million yen, a fund which is replenished whenever calls aro made on it. I have reason to believe that contributions from this fund will be available for any international plague investigations in the Far feast.
The members of the Interchange group from Far Eastern Administrations repeatedly emphasised their belief that Japan shtuld not be classed as a $ar Eastern country from the sanitary point of viow as she has reached a standard very much above the countries represented by them.	I fully believe
that the leadership in medical and sanitary science in the East will pass completely into the hands of Japan in a comparatively short period of time.
~8~
INFORMATIQÎT OCNCERNIUG THE LEAGUE.
It was inevitable that some of our time should be taken up by giving information about the work of the league in general.
At an Armistice Day meeting, organised by the League of Efations Association of Japan, I spoke to an audience of some 1,300 men,
P
being preceded by distinguished speakers such as Mr. Inouye, a former Minister of Finance.
I also lectured to the ¡students of the Law School of the Tokyo University and « this time on the health work of the League - to the Japanese Association and members of the Interchange and the Japanese Public Health Society. Mr. Wilson spoke at a private meeting organised by the League of Nations Association,
He also placed himself at the disposal of the officials of the Foreign Office dealing with League questions, as well as the League of Hâtions Association, ts discuss any questions which they might wish, taking advantage of the presence of a member of the Secretariat* te raise»
Before leaving Tokyo I gaVe a lunoheon to representatives of the leading newspapers, in order to give them an opportunity of asking questions about the League, should they wish to do so.
In fact they asked very little about the League, but a great deal about what we the-ught of Japan.
GENERAL IMPRESS IONS.
Among the general impressions to be recorded, the first must
certainly be that of the hospitality with which we ourselves
x
and all the members of the Interchange were received. Whatever I might say of the courtesy which we met with in every place in which the Japanese were our hosts, er in praise of the execution
The Home Secretary (the new Prime Minister) in spite of heavy Parliamentary duties, spent two full evenings with us, anxious to give information on all subjects. I also met several times, in free conversation, the Permanent Under-Secret ary at the Foreign Office.
x
-9-
\
of the a Aar. ir utile pr ogrormo preparer! by the Japanese Authorities, would be an under-statement. Moreover, wherever we had Finy matters to discuss, whether at the Foreign Office, Home Office or elsewhere, we were frankly treated and helped in every possible way ,
I particularly appreciated the facilities accorded me for studying, on the spot, from village "mairios" to the Government Offices in Tokyo, the working of the administrative machine as it concerns public health* In my technical report I hope to describe this system in some detail. I mention it here because some of its features, especially the methods of recording vital statistics and of keeping sanitary registers, seemed to me to be of exceptional interest.
J,.PAN ANT) THS L3AGUE.
It aoon beccir.GS Obvious to anyone travelling in Japan on League business that such knowledge of the league as there exists is largely due to Dr. .Nitcbé1 a labours, and having been privileged to see at first hand something of the problems which faced him., I should like to place on record m.y admiration of his work. If, after the very interesting reuort on the attitude of Japan to the I-eague which Dr. Nitobo wrote last year, I venture to give m.y own impressions, it is because this is the duty- so it seems to me- of any rr.en.bor of the Secretariat who was fortunate enough to visit Japan.
The essence of the problem, seems to mo how to make the League a reality to Japan. Unlike the other Groat Powers, Japan has not yet seen the League deal with any subject in which she has a strong interest, with the exception of the Protocol.
I cannot help feeling that the League will not become effectively a world organisation until it's machinery is resorted to by Japah {and also by Ohina) for the solutioh of one of the perplexing problem.s confronting the Governments in the ï?ur Bast in their international relations in almost every domain, nolitical, military, economic, cultural, social, health, transit.
-11-
I am only too well awnro of the shyness of European Governments when confronted with n. "leaguo-able" problem, hut "/hilo in Guropo Governments and Parliaments faol bound to explain why certain issues may not be referred to the League, in the Par hast it has never yet been the policy of the Governments oven to mention the Longue in relation to any important problem, nor is there any sufficiently organised public opinion able to create such a frame of mind. Not that the attitude towards the League is in any way hostile; on the contrary, the League, as an institution, seems to bo highly valued, perhaps bee* use the permanent membership of the Council consecrates internationally Japan’s status of Groat power, and the termination of the British alliance may have enhanced this value. The principle underlying the League have a strong appeal to the scholarly minds of the political, educational and science loaders and are certainly very warmly embraced by the younger generation.
lam. convinced that the Japanese are more ready to use their opportunities to hoar about the League's work, at loast if I may judgo by our own experience at Tokyo where I spoke to an audience of some 1,300 men, mostly of the student and teacher class, whom two hours' talk on the League by speakers preceding myself had failed to satisfy. The quite efficient office of the League of Nations Association in Tokyo is as active in propagating information about the League as its' rather limited funds allow. Yet I doubt whether the pro-league propaganda in Japan has yet persuaded any largo number of people that the League is of capital importance to Japan.
It appeared to us that the personnel of the foreign Office, especially some of its younger members, and as high a proportion of the Ministry as elsewhere,
are well disposed towards the
-12-
League. The problem, both for the friendly official and nonofficial circles, seems to bo the same- how to prove that the league really counts! The feeling that the League does not matter tn Japan is not expressed in just that way. The commonest formula is that the League is not "idealistic’’ enough. v'hen this oriticism does not express merely a vague disappointment with the League for having failed to bring in the Millenium, it resolves itself into these two objections :	(1) that the League is
designed to perpetuate the present distribution of power and possessions between nations, (2) that, in fact, the League is an instrument largely in the hands of Great Britain and France, and is indifforent to "justice" and other idealistic considerations. That the League should disarm the other nations seems to be in Japan, as elsewhere, the greatest of its effectiveness.
It was natural that in lecturing one had to answer certain not very easy questions, e.g. what would the League do in the case of war between Jaoan and the U. 3.A.?
The leading newspapers profess to be liberal in tone, in fact they do not represent party interests in the European sense,and. consider that they take far more trouble to make known the work of the League than they could reasonably be expected to do,
I understand that there is no discussion of League questions in the press, or even in Parliament (except occasionally in the House of Peers) and it would therefore seem, unlikely that there should develop in Japan in the near future anything like independent public opinion on League questions, ns is known in European countries. .Nor should the growth of such opinion be well promoted by the League of Nations Association, which is supported by Government funds.
As in Japan the activities of the League are not the subject of controversy in the press or in Parliament, which in other countries is perhaps the League’s best publicity, the
-13-
rr.eana to be adopted for keeping its work before the public becorr.es a rr.ost important problem. Though the efforts of the Association deserve recognition and are supported by many distinguished Japanese, this is clearly a matter in which, given the special circumstances, the Secretariat itself should actively ofloperate, and the question how to ensure the success of the Tokyo Bureau, the establishment of which Dr. hitobe so wisely proposed * Reserves very close consideration.
Before discussing it, T would venture to give a few impressions of a more general nature.
A sense of isolation, and a desire of lasting rapprochement with China, based on community of civilisation and of racial outlook, and prompted by potent economic and political interests,, seemed to me to dominate the political mentality Of the day.
The emigration dispute with the U.5.A. left bitterness behind that differentiates inwardly against the Americans perhaps more profoundly than was the case with foreign traders in open ports ooncessions some thirty years ago. The olaim of "superiority" is resented with a griijr. but polite intensity by every Japanese. It has created, and is visibly deepening, a psychology of understanding of, and with* China. The sympathetic attitude of Japan at the Tariff Conference and in regard to extra-territoriality, is based on memories of Japan's own experiences and on the reoent recognition of the necessity of securing the goodwill of the Chinese nation for the successful development of the policy of economic penetration as opposed to that of military interventions and economic claims, abandoned a few years ago. No doubt the effectiveness of the boycott, the strength of the movement for emancipation and the great moral influence of Soviet Russia on Young China have powerfully contributed to the adoption of the new Chinese policy. But it seems to be based very genuinely on a similarity of outlook, and as times goes on and the influences of the ¿Militarist party in Japan,which
-14-
account for the somewhat erratic progress of the new programme, are increasingly kept in check by the growing, consolousness of Young Japan, the relations will doubtless bocorr.e ir.ore intirr.ate, and endeavours ir.ade to evolve a distinctive frair.e of mind. It will result- one heard often stated by intellectuals-frorr. the application by Japanese and Chinese scholars of teachings of rr.ndern science towards the solution of specific Oriental problems. Moreover, having once decided on a policy of "spiritual" rapprochement with China, Japan has for her use an effective instrument in the faot that the greatest part of foreign-educated Chinese have studied in Japanese Universities, fit is interesting to note in this connection that a Sin-Japanese Research Institute for the practical study of problems of agriculture and public health, is being organised at Shanghai, the Japanese Foreign Office endowing it with part of the Boxer indemnity share to the extant of one million yen per year in addition to the initial outlay for buildings and equipment.A Joint Committee on which Chinese have a majority, with a Chinese Chairman, will have vested in thorn, the property and management of the institution. )
The abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese treaty, almost coinoident with the emigration dispute, was followed by a rapid and dramatic increase in Russia's influence in China.Although the Soviet Government got back part control of the Chinese Eastern Railway and embarked on a policy of hostile competition with the Japanese South Manchurian Company,- the main gateway end instrument of Japanese penetration into Manchuria and beyond- and although in certain respects it follows the traditional policy of Imperial Russia, these developments do not appear to constitute the main reason of the alarm, of the Japanese authorities. Russia's m.ain concern and principal usset rests on her prestige with Young China, likely to be Jeopardised by any too forward bid for economic advantage which certainly
/will not
-15-
1)0 allowod to weaken the groat position won by hor Ambassador in Poking and by her Adviser with tho Canton Government. It is Russia's anti-Japanese propaganda in Peking and in Korea, and Russia as a rallying point of all polities 1 discontent in the East, articulate and semi-conscious, as well as of the growing radical labour movement in Japan proper, which appear to fom the substance of the grave preoccupations of the Japanese Government. Their economic policy is based on the conqcost of the Chinese markets and is apparently wo 11 on tho way to success. The people we met, or heard from at Shanghai, Hongkong, Singapore, our Hutch follow passengers from Batavia, all bore witness to this undeniable fact.
But you cannot have the Chinese markets without tho goodwill of the Chinese people. The boycott has taught a lesson, which, according to testimonies from various quarters, Japan was quick to perceive and to act accordingly. Tho British commercial communities refused to see it and doggodly persist in thoir refusal. There is but one wfcy of securing the goodwill of present-day China - to treat tho Chinese as mastors in their own house and as equals to tho foreign tradors. Japan entered resolutely on this road which may load not only to the solution of her economic and financial difficulties at home but also, at a later date, to a political community of purpose with China. The psyohological basis is firmly laid down but I agree with my progressive Japanese friends in their belief that democratised Japan will alone be capable of, and trusted by China to, consummate this policy which would brilliantly terminate the condition of isolation so heavily weighing on the minds of all thoughtful Japanese to-day.
The bid for a market and for a potential ally is boldly staked. Hqw quickly and completely will it succeed appears to
-16-
depend not so much on the strength of foreign opposition as on the time taken by Japan to emerge from her present state of transition and to crystallise her internal situation.
No real conflicts of social policy or of distinct principles of foreign relations appear to be possible as long as the two groat political parties differ but in name and personalities, as long as the Labour party is non-existent in Parliament^ and as lofig as all arc completely in the dark as to the re so It of the next general oloction which will add 9 million new electors to 4 million of the present votors0 The Government confidently expet to gather new adherents as a result of their - in fact comowhat timid - social legislation. Indeed the opposition of the day is a shade more conservative, representing in the main the interest cf the landowner and the prosperous farmer. Yot the Government simply suppressed by administrative docroo the newly cons titu tod, and much dismissed throughout the country, "Proletarian Party", not a communist organisation but an association of radical intellectuals, a party of Young Japan. This measure may yot fall on both the Government and the opposition with a vengoanco at the elections duo on 1928 but likely to be held earlier and awaited in intense oxpootation of a result w hi eh may provido a way cut of the present uncertainty.
To tho polls will • o millions of young Japanese, educated at modern schools, eager readers of a non-party and progressiva pross (with a very high circulation) and of tracts, pamphlets and literature of every type, oxtremely alort mentally and greatly influenced by modorn tendencies. T^ey are a first complete product of a system which sends to elemontary schools 96¡o of all boys and some 9Qffo of all girls. The primary school visited by us in a village inspected for another reason, appeared
-17"
o
carts.inly to bo superior to Genovese schools in every respect:	curriculum, manual work, physical exercise and
bodily development, knowledge of English, artistic sense of the inmates. The law students whom I addressed on the League and who cross-examined mo very closely struck me as an unusually bright and well-informed lot. A similar impression was gained from a visit to the Keijo Medical Faculty, and to a Girls? Medical School.
My Japanese friends insisted again and again on the intense interest in all novelty, in Western ways of,living (with food and di-ess at the bottom and marriage customs on tho top of the ladder), in Western ideology shown by their own children and typical of tho rising generation. is. very high proportion of them obtain University qualifications. There is already a hypor-produc tion of doctors and I believe the same is truo of some other professions. The younger technicians all are able to converse in English, and of course every Japanese can read Chinese ideaographs.
The lino of demarcation between youth and maturity that marks a profound difference of outlook is set at thirty.
There is remarkable unanimity as to the co-axistonce of those two worlds of thought. If tho next year will see the influence on home politics of the first wave of this rising tide, the next decade should see the young in effective control at home, and ready to develop their professional activities beyond the seas, indeed probably compelled to do so by tho pressure of ever-increasing numbers of highly trained technicians, educationalists and traders.
The infiltration of the young into the various branches of administration is already truly remarkable. We have mot important officials of tho Foreign and Home Ministries,
Governors of Prefectures, Commissioners of Police, etc., belonging to the "new world". Most of them have been to Europe or America - and have visited Geneva or intend to do so Portly.
-18'
Young Japan will support tho league at homo and may booomo hor protagoniste overseas, bnt the league’s utility to tho Far East most be doraons tratod to hor by facts and a systematic and serious effort made to onplain the league’s mentality and methods of vjork. This can hardly bo accomplished by Foreign Office officials or by distinguishod students of League activities from afar.
I submit that this question merits a very special study by tho Secretariat in consultation with the Japanese member of tho Council, It is ny own belief that somo now method should bo tested, as tho systematic presentation of tho permanent work of the numerous League organs which cover such a largo field of activities is a task porhnps beyond tho scope of a simple bureau which tho Information Section is now con tom plating •
In my own domain I found that the very considerable accomplishments of Jupanoso medical and sanitary science aro in a great part inaccessible, being published in Japanese only. '
I found the utmost an:doty for close collaboration on the part of leaders of thD medical world many of whom so far followed our work from a àistanco. I soon realised the t western research workers and sanitarians have much to learn at tho admirable Japanese institutions.. In common consultation we determined the
f
aspects of public health in which advance may be furthered through the instrumentality of the Health Organisation. . An investigation of tho value of certain types of protective vaccination regarded by tho Health Committee as of capital importance will be undertaken in Korea as a result of our conversations.. We conferred
"19“/21 -
with the Central Sanitary Administration and the Foreign Office on the details of the International Sanitary Convention, helped to remove ni sunder standings and prepared the discussions at the forthcoming Paris Conference. The Singapore Bn rear, was discussod in detai1.
In order to assure a continvity of effort wo have set tip a ”Co-ordination Committee" ccmposod of representatives of the Sanitary Administration and of foremost authori tie s in medicine and public health.
This Committee is arranging with ro for the publication of reports embodying original Japanese work on public hoalth problems of international importance. We hope to send several Western technical officers and research workers to join in studios of Japanese centres and institutes for a year or so. Japanese specialist officers vail bo given facilities by us for the study of certain questions on which legislation is impending or administrative measures to follow legal onactmonts. We proposo arranging for a two-term systematic exposition of the modern teaching and practice of preventive medicine by a Japanese professor at two or three centres in Europe.
8.	I would particularly emphasise the intellectual
co-oparation arranged for. It appeals very strongly to our Japanese friends and I would venture to urge the addition of a Japanese and a Chinese scholar of distinction to the membership of the Committee of Intellectual Co-operation.

THE CHINESE QUARENT INI
QUESTION
1. Chi ia is looming ■very Large in the preooo upation of Japan also from the sanitary point of view. In public health Japan ranks inaeeci higher than certain Great Powers and if the term "Far Eastern" is still to imply a centre of epidemic spread, much as it does for India, then Japan emphatically is not a Far Eastern country. But while for the European and .American states, of Japan*s sanitary standard, plague and cholera represent a rather remotedanger, the seven thousand miles and the Suez filter separating them from massive and immediate infection, Japan is but across the way to perennial centres of epidemics. Certain Chinese Treaty ports, e.g., Shanghai, export cholera almost every summer while ;.lague is shipped primarily from India, although Hongkong, the largest port in the world, enjoyed this unenviable notoriety until quite recently, and the present lull does not result from any conscious local effort, as there was none. For Japan stringent quarantine is a grim reality. A model, very efficient, rigid and necessarily expensive Quarantine Service keeps admirably in chock periodic invasions of seaborne epidemics. The experience gained by Japanese Quarantine Officers on their almost permanent "active service" represents an invaluable source of knowledge which I hope will be made available through our 'Co-ordination Committee". Modern as the quarantine stations are in jap,an proper, the establishments in the Leased Territory st Dairen are truly palatial. And yet Japan is ready to hand over this Station, more commodiously and luxuriously organized, and as efficiently run, as in New York, to a Chinese National Quarantine Service as soon as one is set up,,
r
-23-
2. Inereaible as it sounds, China with her fifty odd Treaty ports and her 5,000 miles of sea ooast has no Ouaran-tine Service, Still less credible, the arrangements made by the flourishing International Settlements at Shanghai and elsewhere are most inadequate, although Europeans and Americans are almost exclusively entrusted with functions of Port Health Officers, ’,*0 are selected from amongst local practitioners, sometimes brilliant professors of surgery, with little or no knowledge of public health in general and of port health work in particular. Years of patient labour are spent by delegates of great maritime powers on hairsplitting discussions of theoretical provisions of Sanitary Conventions designeu to protect against a danger which is left practically unchecked at the source controlled by the Powers. A huge gap is thus left in the system of international defences.
A truly peculiar legal situation complicates the problem, Quarantine implies three operations: i) movements of ships in h&rbours; ii ) isolation of cases and contacts on shore, etc; iii) the issuing and the enforcement of quarantine regulations, How in China all movements in harbours fall within the sole competence of the Chinese Maritime Customs, a Service of, but in fact not under, the Chinese Government; all operations on shore are within the exclusive competence of the Chinese territorial authorities, except however, in the International Settlements, while in virtue of existing treaties no regulations can be enforced against vessels flying foreign flags without the consent of their respective consuls,
A situation so anomalous requires clarification. The foreign,mainly British, Chambers of Commerce in China, demanded a consolidation of regulations, first of all at Shanghai, and consent of the consular body was obtained by the Customs Service at Shanghai and subsequently at several other pro ty ports for sots of quarantine- regulations to which foreign vessel;:- are now bound to conform.
But those regulations still
24,
differ widely fn scope end continue to be administered by incompetent foreign part-timers uncorrclated to the national territorial authorities and to each other in the different ports, which are lamentably deficient in sanitary equipment and rathor inefficiently administered.
It will be remembered that it was on the motion of its first Japanese member that the Health Committee decided to send Dr.
Norman White to investigate the Pert health procedure and practice in the Par hast. While in China he visited four or five ports and the discussion of his Beport (which has become a standard wort of reference}, both throughout the Par. hast and in Europe, has kept the question- of Par Eastern ports in general in the foreground of discussions on the Sanitary Convention during the la st two years.
3.	The small team of Chinese Health experts and officers grouped round the only two Chinese Health centres, the Plague Prevention Service of Ear bin that stood the shock of two dramatic epidemics of pneumonic plague in 1911 and 1921 and won v. high international reputation for exportness and efficiency, and the Central Epidemic Disease Prevention Bureau at Peking, which represents a hopeful and very promising but as yet rather inexperienced institution, begun by exploring the legal ground. Having ascertained that the Chinese Customs Service far from claiming competence regards Quarantine as an essential function of sovereign authorities but maintains its rights in the harbours, they proposed to the I.Iinister of the Interior: ( i) that a survey of the Chinese ports be made either by the Bockefeller Foundation or by the League Health Ormani sat ion; ( ii) that a National Quarantine Board bo--set up by Presidential Decree as an autonomous institution free from political interference (five members of whom one foreigner for a period of five years); ( iii) that the Customs be asked to provide maintenance out of the Customs Surplus.
The Ac ting
25 .
Inspector-General of Customs apprised of this move stated in a Minute, In August 1925, his agreement with the proposed survey, would not commit himself as regards a national Quarantine Service while endorsing fully the necessity of comprehensive reforms of the present system and withheld judgment as to finance. The Chinese Cabinet thereupon deliberated and resolved: (1) against inviting the Rockefeller Foundation as incompetent in view nf her non-governmental character to survey ports with proper authority;
(2) for the survey on the express condition that it be dependent on the Inspector-General of Customs undertaking to maintain out of the surplus any Quarantine Service likely to be set up in consequence of the survey. In the meantime the [Directors of the Rockefeller Foundation decided not to accept any invitation fox the survey as it clearly belonged in their opinion to the competence of the league .
The movement is inspired by the Medical Officer of the British Legation at Poking and pc tticu larly by the representative of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation in China. He informed us, in September last, of a possible reference to the League and this prompted me t o visit Peking as at the time we were not conversant either with facts or with the intentions of all concerned. I was accompanied from Mukden by Dr. Wu-Lien-Teh, the head of the Chinese Plague prevention Service who went with us to Singapore as Chinese delegate to the Advisory Council of the Hastem Bureau.
4.	The Peking Government gave us an official welcome, placed technical officers at our disposal, made our stay as profitable and as pleasant as possible, offered us free passes on the railways, etc. The Minister of the Interior, who entertained us officially, and the Under-Secretary of State then Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, discussed with me
26
exhaustively the eventual application for the survey. These discussions 5'/ere or spared, by detailed conversations with the competent officers of the Ministry whom I found most eager to co-operate closely with us. The Minister (a man with considerable experience of his profession and a rare gift of keeping office in successive cabinets, sometime spoken of as head of next government) was genuinely interested and appeared keen on establishing working relations with the League. He gave me the draft of an official request (prepared by his advisers in consultation with us) to the oecrctar'-General for the survey which he was sending to the foreign Office for despatch to Geneva at the opportune moment. He dropped the condition that the survey was to depend on the promise of funds by Customs for a Quarantine Board, and was simply waiting for a formal approval of the survey proposal by the Inspector-General of Customs.	I saw Sir Francis Aglin for one hour.	He was
anxious to see the anomalous situation altered and fully concurred in the necessity for the survey which ho was prepared to pay for. He doubted the feasibility of establishing a Chinese ’ uarantine or indeed any other service administered by the Chinese who for him were utterly incapable of competent and technical work. I suggested that the League machinery might provide a solution perfectly acceptable to China and offering sufficient guarantees for competence of the work but that clearly the time to discuss a ¿Service would come after the Survey which was the preliminary stage in any event it being wiser not to go beyond this stage, at present. He heartily agreed and promised to expedite the application.
It is obvious to me that the negotiating of a final scheme will be a difficult task to be undertaken after the survey has disclosed a catalogue of obstacles to be overcome, and complicated by personal animosities between several camps
of Chinese sanitarians and by ambitions of foreign medical officers of retiring age anxious for new openings in China. The scheme is to me however worth a great effort on our part as it would he of i mense significance for raising China out of primitive sanitary chaos by the setting up of a centre of conscious effort, and o:‘ a very considerable importance for the world's shipping and sanitary maritime defence.
5.	Modern medicine in China is practically non-existent.
The most optimistic estimates of medical practitioners of western education either abroad or in China vary between 25G0 and 10,000. The bulk resides in big cities and a large proportion is well pnder a low European or Japanese standard. The ■ annual output does not exceed a few hundred. Medical institutions are very few outside the large towns. Thus in effect the 400 millions Chinese are left almost exclusively to the care of the Chinese practitioners who base their skill on the tiger hair and lion-skin cures. (That mortality in China is not still higher is a melancholy reflection on the effectiveness of modern medicine. . .)
And yet the modern sanitary iistitutions exclusively staffed by Ghi ese which I visited struck me as very efficiently administered and the competence of the personnel was certainly of
the daPanese standard. Gome o’ the hospitals app ared even more
who
"western” in their management. The Chinese masses,/some fifteen years ago were prone to revolt against plague measures, apply now in thousands for anti-cholera vaccinations in times of epidemics. They appear to accent readily modern measures when usefulness is practically demonstrated particularly by their own people or by foreign doctors living in their midst. As individual therapeutics are out of the question, there is thus a giant field open for preventive medicine.
The eus si ans faced with an analogous problem fifty
-2 Pa-
yeurs ago established a County medioal service on a larger scale even than the Indian Medical Service, It is obvious that some vast system of public preventive medicine must be established, that it must be based on national effort but that to succeed it must he assisted from abroad. Its success is bound up intimately with the control of one of the two most extensive areas of epidemics in the world. It is also closely connected with the progress of the mass education movement actively promoted by a vast association of teachers, administrators and provincial leaders. Any assistance given to the health reformers will ultimately lead to co-operation with the educationalists.
6.	When the U.S.A., with territories as varied in sanitary standards as England and Turkey, set about establishing and consolidating their modern public health system, a Marine Quarantine Service was created as a rallying point of co-ordinated central effort. It has now become the Federal Public Health Service, the most extensive sanitary organization in the world. The Ohinese desire to copy the American precedent ana indeea a crystallizing centre is indispensable and no better could be found than the Quarantine at the ports on which depends the prosperity of the country. There is now a proposal put to Great Britain to utilize one quarter cf the Boxor Indemnity, which by Act oi parliament is to be ¡returned to China, for a comprehensive scheme of public health development at provincial centres, and the successful operation of any suoh project would rest on the existence of a Chinese Sanitary Service.
-29-
The Ministry of the Interior in proof of their earnestness in the matter appointed a special quarantine committee for the study of the problem. I told the Chief Health Officer tj at I would be prepared to recommend to the Health Co ranittee the award of two quarantine study scholarships as soon as the survey was completed, and that a Chinese Medical Officer would be considered for temporary service in the Health Section. A candidate was selected and appeared to me a particularly promising and intelligent American educated technician. He has been appointed secretary to the Quarantine study Committee.
Should the request be addressed in time there would be great advantage for the survey to be started before the International Sanitary Conference which meets in .Paris in May next.

CHINA AND THZ L3ASUB.
7.	Dr.C.T.kang, the new minister ox foreign aifui rs , was President of the Tariff Conference and director of the Sino Russian Relatione Office when I saw him in December. He was interested in the uarantine gestion, nd -eague's "work vîas iox him valuable only .vben limited to nonpolitical activities. The League was not universal /nd even alter the entry of Germany the absence of ¿.meric a and Russia would not allow her to function as a great political institution. Ha personally was not hostile to the League and indeed warmly supported its principles. Yet if conceived ns a political instrument, she was in the hands of one power, Treat brituin.
Equality of treatment was an essential condition for the collaboration of China* League propaganda should concentrate on the Students movement and the southern leaders should be apprised of League's accomplishments and pose ibilities.
He had no intention oi visiting oeneva, arcs t if China's interests were to be directly involved. It was obvious that he knew next to nothing about the League's prpoedure, methods of wort and the record of the last years.
The little he knew was clearly derived from Lr.Hsia of whom he spoke highly. He has made up his mind as to the ^eague and was not inclined at present to alter his views. He made the impression of a very energetic i±uick minded, vigorous man of set nurpose and det ;rmin tion, simple in behaviour sincere and outspoken in conversation. khan contrasted with Dr. fen, late prime minister, Minister to « mdon and delegate to the ¿.eague, he hadthe militant buoyancy
ry -i
-o 1-
of a labour chief while ^r.ien a detached distinction ox a scholarly diplomatist and universally respected liberal leader.
1 sj^oke with . Yen at length about the survey in which he was greatly interested as giving opportunity lor constructive work with the ^eague whose present activities and moral position were not clear to him.
8.	Dr.i-vang, asked my impression of the "seasonal travelling circus", "a disgraceful military display" which he hoped would kill itself by demonstrating to the war lords the futility or their game.
Yet I remembered that Jr.bang owed his position to the successful operations of marshal Feng. This inconsistency seams to me more apparent than real. Both tang and Feng are "porte-paroles" of the hopes and aspirations of Young China. They are prompted to action by the students ...ovament, the real power of China, ..nd by the "Auomintang" , the People's arty established by the late Jr. .un-Yat-Sen, the only political party in the western sense, a reformist-socialist camp with a small communist left wing, and belonging spiritually but not formally to the 2nd International. 'a he students are the driving force, the lino min tang - the political caucus manoeuvring behind the scenes and Feng's "Huominchan" (People's Army), - the armed wing in the movement but not an Army oi a centralised o roan i sat ion.
I have tried to ascertain what are the organised forces and interests in China and was invariably told even by prominent Chinese businessmen that there ’was but the students! ueve-ment, a nation wide organisation. I was particularly impressed when a former 'resident of the Jank oi China, an immensely wealthy Chinese caotain of industry and high finance, not only
-32-
confirmed this view but added that the forward social revendí cations of the students were not causing any anxiety to the business community who regarded it as a duty to support the movement financially. He personally was in favour of a terroristic action by the students against the 50 or so of the militarist loaders who stood in the way of constructivo regeneration of China.
Observers of Chinese life (and a Prench law professor at the Gcvorment University in particular) insist on the force of moral ideas with the students and their penetrating effect on events in China. -One felt that it was the day of groat principles. ’’Young China” impressed me as a Movement, a loose association of groupings centred round the idea of emancipating the country from the ties of "unequal treaties’,' of giving national, and for some, class consciousness to Chinese masses and of endowing the country with the dignity of full nationhood. In this Movement one finds students side by side with militarists, social reformers with financiers, trade union leaders and communist propagandists with captains of industry, scholars of great distinction with professional politicians, A Movement as yet hardly differentiated in accordance with class and party interest, distinctly reformist in character and intensely militant in nationalism. In fact, a Chinese Sinn Pein on a gigantic 3oale with a fully organised and frankly communistic all y ino lined Canton State in the South, with a growing trade-union labour centre at Shanghai and other great international settlements, and a liberal-labour northern nucleus at Peking in open warfare with the Manchurian fortress of reaction impersonated by Marshal Tchang -Tso-Lin.
The real fighting weapon of the Movement is the economic boycott end not the 1st, 2nd .and 3rd "Peoplers armies" of Marshal Peng, of v/hich only the 1st "Muominchan" represents a revolutionary -Puritan force, the, others being legions of usual Chinese
mercenaries with brigandly inclinations attracted by the Marshal’s successes« for the students and the social reformers the boycott is an aggressive arm against foreign imperialism, for the financiers and captains of industry - a valuable business asset, the first Russian Revolution of twenty yoars ago used the strike weapon in a simil r way« In many respects the two pictures correspond.
Students as leaders, supported by most ox what is best but a good deal of what is shady in the n.tion, an awakening of national and class consciousness in the hitherto inert masses, political chaos at the centre - usual corrcllary of neriod of progressing transition - grave misunderstanding of the situation by foreign business commünities and the diplomatic corps, and the all-pervading impression of something inattachable on account of its vagueness and ubiquity. So my mind the influence of Russia is explained by striking analogies in national characteristics. Brilliancy ox intellect coupled with little executive ability, save for meteorically shining exceptions, in a small coherent minority wall capable of assuming control over inert masses of peasantry, innrticul te politically, essenti lly pacific and contemplative but fanatic and cruel on sudden and insignificant provocation. Ihe differences are great and manifold; sound business instinct in the Chinese; small proportion of Chinese intellectuals with technical knowledge as compared with ^ussia, etc.
But the fundamental difference lies to nty mind in the fact that land in China is in the hands of small tenants while all the revolutionary movements in Russia aimed at, and finally succeeded in 1918 in destroying the semi-feudal system of land tenure and making of aussia a country ox small peasant land holde £.
34
The same was in existence in China for a few hundred, years while in Russia it v/as developed only during the last seven years,
I doubt therefore whether communistic propaganda will find a fertile soil in China but just as in Russia the Communistic party found it necessary to base its part on individual tenure of land by the farmer, in China it may derive strength from a support given to militant movement of nationalistic associations. It will also exploit to the full the spiritual relationship between the two countries,
I cannot help thinking that Russians must feel closer related to the Chinese than to westerners* The President of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, declaied to a Chinese journalist that Russians considered themselves brothers-orientals vi th the Chinese, This statement made a very deep impression, and I was asked anxiously by a prominent Chinese expert brought up in England and America whether I thought this welcome
t
declaration could be true,
9,	I doubt whether effective military help was given by
Russia to Feng until recently. The lines of communication from V/erchnio Udinsk on the Siberian line, beyond the lake Baikal, and Kalgan, Feng’s headquarters lead through the desert of Gobi and are maintained by a service of motor trucks. It is true that Russian officers serve in Feng’s armies and we met ourselves at the battle of Yuangisun a Russian in command ox an armoured train, but he has also Italian gunnery
r
experts, American transport and supply organizers and was expecting shortly G-erman officers for general tactical instruction, I had an illuminating talk on this subject with a very able young diplomatic officer from Feng’s civilian headquarters who came on board the international train on'the
35
return to Peking being sent by the Marshal to facilitate the "honourable" retreat. The soldiers, we ourselves saw, were equipped, certainly much letter than the Polish army in 1920. Personal equipment, guns, umbrellas, aeroplanes, stores - all brand new, partly manufactured in China and mostly imported from abroad. Did not the Hectical Officer at Tientsin tell me how a year or so ago the Customs officials found a whole train at the main station loaded with cases marked "Italian marble for the Rockefeller foundation" (a hospital was being built for the Foundation at Peking).
The cases came from Italy but contained guns. Tchang-tso-lin in Manchuria has recently purchased in France BOO aeroplanes of the latest Army model and his fliers were trained by French pilots, one of whom was a fellow passenger in the attacked train. The Secretary of the South Manchurian Railway told me that big German liners call every fortnight at Chinese ports in the Gulf of Pechili strongly suspected of narcotic drug and arms traffic, which is not "illegal" as long as the customs obtain from whoever happens to be the War lord of the district the requisite provincial certificate. Scandinavians, Americans and 3ri ti sh are equally said to be concerned in this trade, which has in effect transformed the railway zones throughout China in an immense military camp with a soldier population of over one million.
It was a current joke until last year that Chinese soldiers stopped fighting when it begins to rain and in any case stopped short of hurting one another, - a typical self-deluding catch-word. Pc saw actual warfare in the real modern style and the Peking hospitals were receiving severe cases by the hundred . Me were utterly amazed at the apparent	of the soldiers and the absolutely calm, almost
smiling countenance with which they went into action. They
36
were the flpuritans” of Feng, wearing a red bracelet with the motto particularly comforting to the civilian population "RahJaer die than rob the people”, well-disciplined and univer1 sally so recognised, even by Feng’s foreign opponents, strict teetotallers, employed in period of peace on road building, scavenging and generally reconstructing the country side, being regularly taught and instructed in civics. The Americans are usually told by the clever civilian staff officers that the Bible is read before battle as a strict
i
rule, hence the "Christianity" of the Chinese "Cromwell1'.
The battle of which \.e saw the first day raged far’ a fortnight before Feng brake through and there is little doubt that his soldiers are becoming conscious of the cause they arb fighting for. I met some of their teachers.
10c	I called at the headquarters of the "Mass Education
Movement Association" which aims at teaching 70 million illiterate adults of active age to read and write through a
3	month’s course intended to impart to them one thousand
/
ideographs of a simplified type# They have started in
Feng’s army extended teaching even to Tchang-tso-lin’s
troops but their main effort is in the villages where three
million pupils are at present inscribed on the books of the
field units. The Association is typically Chinese, it has
no budget; it engenders action and works out programmes and
policies while Provincial Councils, Teachers’ Unions,
, / *
Students’ Circles, etc. are carrying out their work. They publish a very interesting journal used at the classes th throughout China. A truly pacifist teaching is conveyed to the millions whose humbers are increasing every year. The leaders of the Association have but the vaguest idea of the league. It is a delusion to bcliovo that Young China desires to transplant uncritically ’western institutions; on the contrary, the social workers, the medical officers I meH,
27
ceaselessly insisted on the necessity of finding their own vjsy . They had their training in the 'est, hut the teachings were not applicable to Eastern conditions. Research vas necessary to discover the Eastern ways. The educationalists were not in the least interested in the progress and achievements of the Adult Teaching movement in Europej it was discounted in advance as not applied) le to them. I have the impression that this zeal is hut a passing phase of a new nationalist movement comparable to the Irish attempt to introduce Gaelic
t
into daily life.
I am aware that these, ray tourist impressions of Chinai vher, we spent only 15 days including travelling, must need correction, To one conclusion, however, I have been led by too many lines of evidence to doubt its substantial truth, namely that the principal factor in the whole troubled, situation is the growth of nationalistic movement which must be taken very seriously into account by foreign Powers.
moreover, to my thinking an urgent effort is needed to
disseminate in China accurate knowledge about the real char-
/
actor of the activities of the League. This task seems comparative^ easy as it can only be directed to a few centres of action and as the atmosphere is propitious in view of the wide awakening and extreme receptivity of whatever exists in the way of public opinion. But the effort must be made immediately lost the adversaries of the League take the initia tivc of an anti-League campaign which would find a most favourable ground.
The term "International" la s a sinister meaning in China and I would suggest at once that any League enquiry or activity of any kind in China should be in the hands of experienced members of technical committees or outside experts.
^ p
V.'e must demonstrate to the Chinese the impartiality of the Teague’s executive organs, and the genuine cooperation which is possible between nations within the League•
The point may be raised as to whether there easts in China a Central Government, The Ministry at Peking certainly possesses little or no political authority outside a comparatively small radius. The bulk of the Chinese people live a primitive life and for the immediate purposes of Government the provincial Administrations represent the source of authority, But as regards political activity relating to international trade, shipping, to internal transit and development of industry^ the Central Government seem to possess real competence, In particular they are certainly recognised by the whole of China as hex’ spokesmen in foreign relations ind in their endeavours to obtain full autonomy in regard to tariff and kindred matters,
Peking continues to be the seat of a highly centralised bureaucracy and from what I have heard this bureaucracy goes
on exercising its functions as it has done for centuries
/
past. It appears that although it is very difficult to get a move on, once an action is started it usually follows its bourse until the logical administrative conclusi 011s and establishes a precedent.
The establishment of working relations with genuinely representative Chinese seems to me to be of some urgency.
The appointment of Or. Yen as delegate should facilitate this work.

THE SINGAPORE CORFEREHCE, January 4th to 7th, 1926.
1.	The scope of work and the estimates of the Singapore Epidemiological B. reau were drawn up last February by a Conference convened by the Council and attended, by delegates from Straits Settlements, Federated lie.lay States, Siam, India, Indo-China, Ceylon, Hutch E: st Indies, Hongkong, STapan, Philippine Islands, Cninu and British Worth Borneo. Tie Conference proposed, inter alia, the setting up of an Advisory Board which, by Council resolution on the Health Committee's recommendation, was to consist of membersnominated by the Administrations invited to the February Conference. Ceylon declined, bu Australia accepted the invitation. The first session sat from January 4th to 6th to determine the usefulness of the Bureau, to consider its financial future and recommend estimates for 1926, and to discuss its further technical utilisation. The same delegates attended last year, except for Australia who took the pQace of Ceylon, the British Sanitary Adviser who sat for Siam instead of Prince nakol, and China, who was represented by the Head of the Plague prevention Service and not by the Singapore Consul. Hr. Reiser, Director for the Far East of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation attended, as benevolent observer.
2.	All the administrations represented, and as I ascertained on my return journey, also Ceylon and the Sanitary, Maritime and Quarantine Service of IQypt, found that the Bureau was rendering them valuable services. The essential task of the Bureau is to collect by cable information on prevalence of epidemic diseases at ports in an area extending from Vladivostok and Japan to Cape Town and Port Said, and including Australia y as well as to obtain intelligence on movements of "infected" ships, to
/collate
40-
collate it and re-telegraph in special code in the form of weeklv bulletins, confirmed subsequently by mail by a somewhat more extended printed "fasciculus'T. There are 100 important ports in the area, divided into four groups each receiving telegraphic information limited to itself. The zealous Director of the Bureau issued in April last the first bulletin with information on four or six ports; at present he deals with 70 odd and will reach the 100-port marie in o month or two.
The bulletins are broadcasted every Friday, free of charge, by the French station of Saigon and repeated the samdeday by the Bombajr station for the benefit of the Indian ports and ships at sea. Since January 24th the Dutch station of Bandoens, Malabar, re-broadcasts the Saignon message on Saturdays, and v;e will look into possibilities of repeating it again from St.Asize, Rugby, and Ifauen. The air in the Far Bast seems to be capricious, full of electric disturbances preventing the normal picking up of messages, which is complicated by commercial and other rivalry, and in places by laziness and incompetence. Hitherto, wireless was confirmed by cables for the transmission of which we failed to obtain Government rates, much to the surprise of the Governments in the Far Fast who expected more of the prestige of the Leagme. As the cables for 1926 would have cost about 80,000 gold francs, the Board, partly on my advice, decided to offer free wireless bulletins in exchange for the weekly returns from
ports,and will confirm by cable only on request and at the demander's expense, recommending the use of prepaid replies, thus ensuring to Governments the usual reductions. I mention those do,tails which may be of interest to the Information and Transit fictions.
3.	Having by this, and other means, conpressed the estimates
/to
\
-41 -
to a minimum the Board was still faced by a deficit of some 60,000 gold francs over the Rockefeller subsidy of 125,000 g.f. India, Japan end China proposed, and the Board passed a resolution expressing the belief that the League should contribute herself, and then members declared the willingness of their Governments to subscribe as follows: -
French Indo-Cliina S.0 6,000 in addition to free broad-Dutch Bast Indies " "10,000	do..	do. casting.
Straits Settlements " '' 5,000 (paid in September)
Siam	" " 2,000-
China (paid)	" " 2,000
Japan	Yen 7,000 to 10,000 in proportion to
other subscriptions, to be raised to 15,000 should the Deputy Director be a’ Japanese II.Q.
India, .Australia and Ceylon offered to pay for cables, Australia adding a "pro rata' for general expenditure. The Ihilippines made a similar declaration for 1926, promising at least 5,000 S.$ for 1927 and emphasising that the payment is expressly authorised by tie Home Government.. The Federated Malay States and Forth Borneo hope to pay this year a few thousand each, and Hongkong
S.	$5,000 from 1927. The deficit is thus amply covered.
4..	The Board further decided to ask the Health Committee to
start earnest studies of the great public health problems of the East, and in particular to set up expert Committees for the coordination of enquiries into the value of oral vaccination against acute intestinal infections, into endemic centres of cholera, into certain aspects of bubonic plague and into the possibility of corporate action for the study of pneumonic plague on the lines of the Sleeping Sickness Mission. A study of tuberculosis was also recommended on principles analogous to those rr oposed by the South African Union. I may add that the Japanese member at the October session of the Health Committee made somewhat similar proposals which approved in principle will come up for consideration in April.
The session of the Advisory Council was certainly very
successful.
5.
-42
There -as but one
incident,
satisfactorily liquidated, and
throwing interesting light on the constitution of the Advisory Council. The resolution of the health Committee approved by the Council recommending the creation of the Advisory Council stated that one or two representatives of the Health Organisation should be added to its membership, and that one of them should take the chair. The Health Committee expected that Dr.JAtta, Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission of the Corjaittee f would be able to attend the Singapore Conference. I thought that a member of the Secretariat could not preside over a Technical Commission and it seemed to me that the Advisory Council formed a special Sub-Committee of the Far’Eastern Commission, and was therefore in fact presided by Dr. Jitta, but as a special Sub-Committee it should constitute itself by electing its officers. In view of the importance of British India, both from the public health and the Assembly point of view, and in view of the personal distinction of her representative, Colonel Graham was ashed to take the chair. The representatives of non-British territories expected to share the honours, and we suggested that the French, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese and Siamese delegates be elected vice-Chairmen. This at first was opposed by all the British members, but I ..m glad to say that, after negotiations, they accepted unanimously, the next day, the suggested constitution of the Bureau* I found that the non-British members were rather suspicious of the character of the Bureau and were verv anxious indeed that its connection with the League should be as close and as permanent as possible. I -ound that Ceylon was not represented for much the same reason, in view
of the opposition of the Cingalese members of the Legislature. I hope they will not persist in their opposition after the interviews which the Chief Medical Officer of Ceylon and myself had, during my short stay at Colombo, with two Cingalese leaders and the Colonial Secretary.
- 42 -
It would tie useful to reconsider the constitution of the hoard. this opportunity will le provided in 1927, because the mandate of the health Committee terminates at the end of this year and constitutionally all or its subcommittees and commissions would have to be re-appointed.
Of course the continuity of the work will be assured, and, with the exception of one or two temporary sub-committees, the majority Taill continue their activities. After some discussion with the delegates v/e might, I think, suggest that hanitary Administrations or members of the League should have each a delegate on the Council, namely, Japan, China, Australia, oiara, Holland and ¿’ranee. 'The same would apply to the Philippines and to Vladivostok. As regards the Crown Colonies and possessions, they should have a definite number of seats, say two or three for the Lritish, one or two for the Japanese and the French, those seats being held in rotation by delegates selected by the respective Colonies in consultation.
6.	The Bureau, as the only League institution in the Par
Last, attracts considerable attention, particularly in Japan, China, French-Indo-China and the Dutch last Indies and lritish India. Aequests for information regarding the League are frequently addressed to the Bureau. The Japanese Ministry of the Interior and the Foreign Office emphasised their interest in the Bureau provided that it should have no executive functions and that its character be strictly international. The Dutch and the French welcome the link established with our Health Organisation, and British India thinks that it shows, in its activities and developments, a
guarantee that the reague will take a real interest in the public health problems of the ^ast. It is obvious to me that a Deputy-Director should be appointed \ ith the least possible delay. He would not as technical secretary to the various studies and investigations recommended by the Singapore Conference and executed by the several Health Administrations.
He would have to ensure permanent contact between the various sanitary administrations and have to spend a great part of his time in travelling. i’he Director of the Bureau, who is retiring from the straits settlements service at the end of the year and who is at present on part-time service with us, may not continue his position and the selection of a deputy becomes thus doubly important. I have been making enquiries since July last and so far have not found any suitable candidate, who must either be already acquainted with the league's work and procedure or must work with us two or three months before going to Singapore.
1 reel confident that the highly satisfactory character of the Bureau's work will be fully acknowledged at the forthcoming International Sanitary Conference r.nu that the Convention will entrust definite duties to the Bureau as a centre of epidemiological intelligence. Its existence and the development of its activities facilitate singularly the work of the Sanitary, liaritiue and luarantine service of L'gypt, a semi-international body set up some 40 years ago, and now in the period of reorganisation which should make of it an efficient service in a year or two. It is not impossible that its constitution will come up for discussion at the Paris Conference. It was obvious
to me that the Administrations in the mast are somewhat bewildered at the continuous co-existence of several international health organisations and are rather anxious that some iinal permanent order should be- evolved as soon as possible.

impress 10j-j or Russia .mid ;i:h;.a.,.
'The long .journey in the Transitorian train afforded an opportunity for interesting conversations with fellow passengers complemented by the teading of local newspapers and of a very abundant literature on far eastern problems published in Moscow. This 'literature, of which I obtained a nearly complete set, may be classed in three categories: (a) propaganda; (b) publications by the Intelligence Department of the peel grmy obtainable at every library. They include a China and a Japan Year Book, each a respectable volume with charts, photographs and statistics etc. This type of publication is mainly cornpllatory in character and contains much useful information; (c) Magazines and scientific publications. I found "The Kew Orient", a quarterly review of the round-the-table type, the most interesting of the series.
It contains various studies of the economic, political, social scientific, etc. aspects of the life in all the Par Eastern countries. It opposes clearly the p,resent Par Eastern policy
i,
of the Soviet Government which, in its main lines, seems to differ but little from that of Imperialist pussia as regards the anxiety to establish firmly Russiars influence throughout tho East. The methods are different but there are elaborate explanations why the Chinese Eastern Railway should continue to be under Russia's influence .
Conversations I had confirmed my impression of the remarkably cuick recovery of Moscow. The city looks cleaner and. more orderly than before the war. Public buildings redecorated and repainted make the impress ion of new palaces, pavements much superior to previous practice, traffic brisk and better regulated than in Geneva, stores full of merchandise, foodstuffs inexpensive new houses, both for offices and flats, being built on all sidos.
-46-
Of course the housing question continues to be a hideous aggravation of life. But anyone fortunate enough to be able to afford to put in good repair a dalapidated small house, or part of a house* the municipality which owns all the buildings will let it to him for a nominal rent for three years with option to prolong for two more* a new house is given to whoever builds it at his own expense, tax free, for a forty years1 possession with leave to let at his own rent.
The foreign trade is still up to some 75,o in the hands of the State, the balance being left to licensed private firms, which have to apply for a spocial importation permit for every new trading season. The 'h/nahstorg", the ¡State Export Trade Office, is heavily attacked by Mr. Dzierzynski, formerly head of the Tcheka and then Hailway Commissioner, a man of unusual organising genius who is now President of the Central Board of National Economy and is responsible for the rapid development of state industry. He holds that a State Control agency should not engage in trade itself and favours the opening up of foreign trade to private enterprise under stflct G-bvernmehtal control* He engages and pays high salaries to best specialists available for the State industries. Every month a new branch is being opened or widened and the progress in a few years is likely to be remarkable. The management of state pro Auction is based on a detailed plan which takes into account the world markets, the process of raw materials, uhe results ox the harvests, the purchasing power of the various parts of the Union etc. Co-efficients of error are introduced each month as expectations fail to mature or new conditions arise and this "production according to plan" is regarded as the specific characteristic of the soviet economic regime and a real achievement ox the Revolution. If true, ft certainly is an interesting development and worth an earnest study, particularly at a time alien an International economic Conference is being prepared.

Amongst the passengers ':e met a high ¿tate official, a gallant old man full of common sense about the conditions in Russia and the achievement and shortcomings of his Tarty7s Government. With understandable pride he insisted on Russia's getting on her feet again without foreign loans and assistance.
In his vie'.’? Industry was developing, financial crisis was overcome, natural riches of the countrywere proving the most trusted ally of the Soviet Union which knew fcow to utilise even the undeveloped wealth by assuring to herself a substantial participation in the profits of new concessions like the Japanese mining arrangements in the northern part of Sakhalin. State capitalism was making good but private capitalism was rapidly gaining strength, which was so characteristic of the present situation. It is perhaps the capitalist organisation of the economics of every-day life, never the State auspices, rather than capitalist undertakings. The inequality between the worker and the entrepreneur, the intellectual and the successful tradesman was glaring. It was growing with the constant rise of prices. Manufactured products were out of reach of the average family, suits and shoes, e.g. twice the mean of London. It is true that the health insurance system was extensive and complete with old age and invalidity pensions (£5 and fO Rb. a month) but the unemployment benefit as not so certain and men continued to be out-of-work. /ages were low, working hours while reglamentary yet heavy, life continued to be very hard
for the proletariat assuredly victorious on the political field
but all round a new
48 ~
profiteering class and a new capitalistic minority knew hov; to enjoy life in spite of the high cost of living. Tho communal mode of economic practice was still in its infancy, consumers unions and co-operative societies were in the hands of inoxperioncod and at times, particularly since the ro-introductioh of the vodka State monopoly (for fiscal reasons] of very unscrupulous managers. Elementary education very far from approaohing general application. There was a dearth of teachers, school-books and most primitive schooling utensils, not to spoak of unheated school rpoms during successive winters. And how many districts had no schools at all. Illiteracy was still rampant and the State did not put all its strength in the direction of public instruction, while possibly paying too much attention to costly novelties li.ee giant electrification plants. Fortunately the early days anarchy in the management of oven elementary schools was over but the standard of teaching was very low end the rising generation a "great unknown" as a factor of the new Society. In the meantime nationalism was growing and acquiescence on the part of many earnest workers in the Soviet machinery was due tj the recognition of the new regime as a factor making for great and prosperous Russia. Anti-Jewish feeling amongst the Ukrainian peasantry was a source of real apprehension. The world revolution was distant and did not Lenin himsolf insist that perhaps many a generation will pass before the Soviet Union becomes a worldwide, or an European organisation. There is however the growing unrest in the Far and Near East. But this will not make for a communist upheaval in the world.
In short - their Revolution is firmly established at the price of heavy sacrifice, immense effort has been and is still being fcodo for making of the Union a strjngly organised State, able to
49.
defy the world, if neoessary, the economic conditions ere improving d.ai?^y but this is not the Communist organisation of the Society nor is it reasonable to expect relief from a Communist revolution in any important country.
Shorn my talks with the men of a humbler social condition and from literature, I was anxious to form an idea as to the present conditions of land tenure. land reform is apparently completod in its present stage. Peasants were left in the possession of the land they held individually : or taken fro© the landlords, throughout the period of tho civil war. Some two years ago a full assessment was made based on the size of the occupiersr families, a limit being allotted per hoed of family, the standard varying in aocordanoe with the nature of the soil, the district, the marketing possibilities, oto. The lots are not continuous and holdings represent agglomerations of dispersed lots. Whatever remains unallotted of a former estate was turned into model farms, local conditions permitting. All land belongs to the "landfund" and the peasants are in fact i:freeholdlf tenants paying since 1924 one single land tax covering all thoir obligations towards tho State, a tax varying of course with the State budgets. On the death of the chief of the family, or one of its members, or on the marriage of the daughter, the correspond~ ing unit is simply deducted from the holding and goes into local reserve. This is administered by the provincial or county or communal branch of the ,5iand£und'', whose central organs appear to be appointed while the provincial are elcctod. Lease from tenants by private contract and on the basis of the division of profits is permitted by leave of the Landfund. The right of inheritance was recently recognised buttho peasant obviously cannot leave land by his will and he is limited as everybody else to bequesting his
50
personal belongings. While this arrangement 'seems to have been accepted with satisfaction, the technique of agricultural practice and trading is apparently totally disorganised. Oo-operative societies do not work efficiently and the training of a new generation of managers and officials is eagerly looked for. Wheat and flour get into the hands of speculators and the pross is fully occupied in a campaign for popularising a now State scheme of purchase, storage and distribution of flour. Colloctivo purchases of agricultural machinery appear to be practically non-existent and here also progress is expected and demanded by the tenants.
The peasants have learned, it seems, to appreciate the value of the national possessions mineral and otherwise, and the "hunger of capital" for investment is widespread. There appeers to be felt b._ a very large mass of the people a certain pride that Russia has undertaken an unique experiment in the history of mankind and is coming out of it with real success as regards victory over all external foes and the overcoming of all boycott and embargoes. Rut while it cannot be regarded as a xenophobia yet a changed feeling towards the foreigner is fairly general, he being regarded as having previously enjoyed in Russia undue privilegos.

Tho Aoting President of the Counoil will deolaro tho mooting opon and call for tho appointment of a Credentials Committee» The list for this Committoo will bo proposed on bloc und when it has been eleotod, the President will adjourn tho Assembly in order to enable it to meet at onoe.
It is suggested that it should meet in a room at tho Salle do la Reformation and that all delegations who have not put in their credentials should bo invited by tho President to hand them in there and then.
It is thought that if those arrangements are carried out, the meeting oould, without difficulty, « bo resumed at 4,30 (perhaps even at 4 o'olook).
Resumed mooting of tho Assembly.
When the Report of the Credentials Committee has been road and adopted, tho acting President will hold tho election for tho President of the Assembly.
The President of the Assembly, aftor taking his seat, will;

(b)	Propose the appointment of two main Committees and assign the questions on the agenda "between those- two Committees,
(o) Propose the appointment of an Agenda Committee or alternatively submit for the agreement of the -assembly that the appointment of such a Committoo is unnecessary for the special Assembly*
fd) So far the ordinary procedure of the assembly has been followed, but the various formalities described have, in the past, ended the first dayTs work, and the election of Chairmen of the Committees and "Vice-Presidents of the assembly has been taken on the second morning.
It would seem that in the case of an Assembly whinh would only last a few days, it is eminently desirable that all the formal procedure of elections, ate., should be oomplotod on the first day, and as there are only two Commissions, there seems to be no great difficulty in doing soi If this be acceptor, the President might explain as above and say that ho thinks the two Committees might proceed immediately to the election of their respective Presidents, he himself acting as Chairman for each election. He would perhaps adjourn the Assembly for 15 minutes in order that each Delegation might designate its members of the two Committees, and at the and of that period call the first Committee to order and ask for proposals for the Chairman. As soon as the Chairman of the first Committoo is elected, ho would do the same for the second.
(o) As soon as the Chairman of the two Committees aro appointed, the -assembly could prooood immediately to the election of its six Vice-Presidents, and as soon as this has been done, it might bo possible still the same evening to hold a meeting of the General Committee thus constituted, and publish in the next morningTs Journal the arrangements which it would make for the next day's work.
(I)} IKoGDAMME FOR TUESDAY, March 9th:
It seems hardly possible to foresee at present v/ith any certainty, what will be the best arrangomonts for the second day's programme, but it seems likely that there may be advantage in keeping the morning free for a meeting of the Council or its Minority Committees, etc., and to hold in the afternoon the first meetings of the two main Committees of the
-assembly
(i
SECRETARIES OP THE TWO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES:
Presumably Monsieur Mantoux and Mr. Bieler will act as Secretaries of the two main Committees« They will no doubt bo able to make, in consultation with Monsieur Vigier and Mr. Huston, the necessary arrangements as regards Minutes, interpretation, documents, etc.
(ii) MM. do Montonach and Wilson might again act jointly as Secretaries of the President and of the General Committee of the Assembly*

Il arrive quelquefois eue les Etats membres le la Société des Hâtions adressent au Secrétariat des communications dirigées contre un autre membre de la Société afin d'être portée à la connaissance des membres du Conseil ou des membres de la
Société.
Il est évident que de pareils procédés ne sont pas de
nature à faciliter la coopération entre les nations.
Le Secrétariat en les communiquant aux membres du Conseil oxi aux membres de la Société joue un rôle qu'il doit, à
mon avis, éviter.
Pour ces raisons, je me permets de soumettre à votre appréciation la suggestion suivante :
"Comme règle, le Secrétariat se refuse à recevoir
et à transmettre des communications dirigées contre un Jtat tant que ces communications ne contiennent pas une demande d1 application d’une procédure de la Société des Hâtions prévue dans le Pacte."
denies les communications réclamant l'intervention de La Société, même si elles contiennent des accusations contre un autre Etat peuvent être considérées comme recevables. Leur but est le règlement d’une difficulté et par là l'amélioration des relations internationales, Les communications contenant des accu
sations mais sans demande de procédure ne sont pas de nature à rechercher l’arrangement d’une difficulté, enveniment les relations entre les Etats et comme telles doivent être ignorées par la Société et le Secrétariat.

Le projet actuel ne comporte qu'un nombre très restreint do notes explicatives; à moins d'indication contraire, les notes figurant au budget du présent exercice ( C-. 619.Ivl.,201.1925 UI.) , seront reproduites dans le budget qui sera goumis_à la Commission de contrôle et qui sera envoyé à l'impression vers lo 6 avril.

Crédits demandés
Frs, 10C.0C0
On a groupé dans ce Chapitre toutes les dépenses relatives à une Conférence économique générale et à des réu-
nions d’experts ou des conférences partielles pouvant servir à la préparation d’une Conférence générale ultérieure.
Pour cette raison, les dépenses d’une réunion des experts sur la double imposition ont été supprimées dans le Chapitre lia et si une réunion de ce genre a lieu en 1927, ce qui paraît assez probable, ces frais devront être couverts sur le présent chapitre.
le Comité économique n’a pas encore pris de décision définitive concernant la réunion d’une Conférence générale. Cependant, il tient à ne pas exclure la possibilité d'une réunion générale en 1927 sur le problème des prohibitions d'entrée et de sortie,
En outre, il envisage une conférence d’experts sur les lettres de change et éventuellement une consultation sur la question de la répression des fausses déclarations en douane.
2.- SESSION DES COLITES ET 30U3~C0MIf£S,
a) Indemnités .journalières, frais de voyage et de mission,
dépenses diverses,
Crédits demandés

le crédit prévu est le meme qui figure au budget de 1926, nais la répartition prévue du crédit n’est pas la même. Une
et du Comité économique qui sont porté
s de 5
6.000	à 65.000 franc
31
L1entrée de l’Allemagne à la Société des Nations entraînera, en effet, la nomination d'un nouveau membre dans chacun des Comités»
Ce chapitre comporte, d’ailleurs, autre les dépenses des Comités (quatre sessions prévues pour chacun d'eux), les frais de voyage pour la préparation des sessions, ees frais devant être accrus par la nécessité d'assurer la liaison avec l'Allemagneo
Il est prévu, en outre, 20.000 francs pour les travaux du Comité mixte des Crises et 10.000 francs pour la collaboration avec l’Institut International des Statistiques.
Sn revanche, les prévisions qui figurent au budget de 1926 en vue d'une réunion d'experts sur la double imposition ont été supprimées de ce chapitre» (Voir chapitre précédent).
2b.- FRAIS D’IMPRESSION ET DE POBIICATION POUR ESS COMITES.
Crédits demandés ..................... 50.OC0 francs.
(Chiffre identique au crédit prévu pour 1926).
Certaines publications (notamment les rapports sur la reconstruction financière de l'Autriche et de la Hongrie) seront sans doute interrompues, mais il est vraisemblable que d’autres prendront leur place. Le Comité économique a décidé, notamment, la publication des rapports transmis par les Gouvernements en exécution de la convention sur les formalités douanières.

b)Frais de déplacement (déménagements compris) du Secrétariat .................................
1927
Francs suiss 75,000
L1augmentation par rapport à 1926 résulte
(1)	du fait auo plusieurs membres de Sections seront ajoutés au personnel de la Section;
(2)	du fait que lTannle 1926 verra la première échéance de tous les contrats de 7 ans et *u’il ost, par conséquent, nécessaire de prévoir des frais de déménagement plus élevés aue dans une année normale. Cas frais grèvent IJ exercice 1927, les frais de déménagement n’ étant réglés par la Société des Nations qu1 ivres une période àr os s ai d’un an.
c) Impression et publica

sur la base
145,000
Cette somme a été établie suivante :
Bulletin mensuel de statistique ....... 20,000
Annuaire s ta tis ti que	.......... 25,000
Balance des Paiements (Deux volumes) .. 35,000 Monnaies et banques centrales
(Deux volumes) .. 25,000 Volume nouveau sur les banques privées 15,000 Finances publiques (Deux volumes) .. 85,000
Total ......... 145, OOP
Ces prévisions comportent une augmentation pour le Bulletin Mensuel due â l’augmentation du tirage et à l’accroissement du nombre des statistiques publiées.
Une dépense nouvelle pour l’annuaire statistique qui sera un résumé sous une forme commode des principales statistiques parues dans differentes publications de la Société des Nations.
Une dépense nouvelle pour un nouveau volume sur les banques privées.
En revanche, les frais d’impression pour les autres volumes seront inférieurs aux dépenses effectives réalisées en 1985.
Il est rappelé que les dépenses de ce chantre ne sont pas des dépenses nettes et qu’elles sont dans une large mesure équilibrées par une recette croissante de la vente des publications.

CQlSCoIITS BY THE ShORE TARY-GLXISR Al,
I see that at the Directors' Meeting of \pril 15th the question of the payment of certain expenses for the purpose oi propaganda in connection "ith the journey made by a member of the Secretariat to his own country, was discussed. The question interests me very much, and I should be grateful to be given an opportunity of expressing ay view in aetail before any decision of principle is arrived at, or before an„ step which may prejudice such a decision, is taken.
I consider that it is in principle undesirable that a member of the Secretariat shall, at the expense of the League, arrange meetings or lectures for propaganda purposes, wherever it nay be. It is already a very great help in the propaganda work that members of the Secretariat are granted travelling expenses and subsistence allowance during the execution of such work in their own or in other countries. This, I think, is well-founded, end should bo maintained for the tine being and until we feel that we can dispense '"ith such an arrangement.

Mr. Co lban
On the general question of principle I entirely share your v5.C7.s-, As to whether in the special case discussed at the Directors’ lace ting a snail grant should be made to allow the lectures to be given, i.e0 a grant in reality to those who arranged the lectares - I an prepared to accept any decision which iL Wenol, 1L Cornert and ^ir Herbert Ames nay have reached*

Confidential Circular 8„19260
I JOTS BY THE SECSSTAEY-GEJISAI.
The attached exchange of Minutes between llx ■. Cobban and the- Registrar is circulated to Directors and Chef fie Sections in order that an opportunity nay be given to the different Sections of expressing their views on the natter before the discussion tabes place at the Directors' Meeting,
I should be glad if the various Sections would send in any observations they nay care to make before May loth*
The Registrar.
I have noticed that there is a certain tendency to increase the use of X files. I have not the slightest objection to this. On the contrary, I think that the Z file system should be used as much as possible where it map/ be assumed that a file will net be required for circulation in different offices of the Secretariat, but is always needed in one single Section, or at any rate, not in two different offices at the same time. But what I feel is less satisfactory is the way in which Z files are arranged. One paper is simply put on the top of the other without any discrimination as to the contents, and in this wap/ minutes and notes by the various members of the Secretariat are to be found filed in between copies of outgoing or incoming correspondence. As many short minutes may be written on the same Minute Sheet, it is thus impossible to observe chronological order. The result is
that when I get hold of a somewhat voluminous X file I may spend quits a long time in finding out how the matter dealt with in the file really stands. It would, to my mind, he very desirable indeed to introduce a new system for X files, and to file the -correspondence - that is, incoming and outgoing letters - on the right side of the jacket, and minutes, with their possible annexes, on the left side.	The file would then have to ho read
in exactly the same way as an ordinary file, and it would he easy at all times t? see exactly what was the last note or minute and the last incoming or outgoing letter.
As this matter does not concern my Section only I intend to bring it before a Directorsr Meeting at an early opportunity, and should he grateful if you would let me have your observations from the Registry point of view.

Ur. Golban«
With reference to your note of yesterdayTs date,
I am glad to have your views as to the usefulness of making X files for papers which do not need to be circulated to several Sections of the Secretariat, views which quite coincide with my own opinion.
With regard to the order of minutes and other papers in X files, the present rules in the Standing Instructions of the Registry read as follows:-
TTOrdcr of papers in X Piles,
"The correspondence under each sub-number {schedule number) in an X file should be filed in the following ascending order, on the right hand side of the jacket;
1)	Inward communication,
2; Outward communication, if any, arising cn 1.
3]	L'inutos concerning 1 and 2,
The minutes should not come between the inward communication and the outward one arising on it.
The minutes, if consisting of several pie-res, should bo arranged among themselves in the same order as in ordinary files, that is in ordinary chronological order, with the earliest cn top and the latest underneath. Minutes should not remain on the left hand side of the jacket, but should always bo in-sorted in thoir proper places on the right hand side. Distributed documents should be placed under the minutes,"
From the Registry point of view there would hardly be any’ objections against changing these rules and adopting the procedure proposed by you, vis., that all the minutes in the file should be kept together and separated from the correspondence.	I am, cf course, willing to take the
course ’Which seems to bo most convenient for the Sections. Before changing the rules, I should, however, like to have the views cf the Sections and I should be glad, therefore, if the Question could be discussed at a Directors' Meeting.
I may point out, however, that I am net quite sure that the present method does not have certain advantages as against the method proposed by you. !7ith the present system, involving that the minutes arc kept in immediate connection with the documents, which they concern, it is,
I think, less likely that a member studying the file would fail to observe the minutes belonging to a particular document. Minutes concerning different documents ought, of course, not to be written cn the same paper.	$one
minutes are quite unintelligible hen s_paratee rrom •tneir
4
associated papers. One often cones across minutes such as "Herewith Council Locuncut and Letters to A, B and C.,T "Please see attached draft letter" or simply "Ho action", "Seen", If minutes such as these are to he kept entirely apart from the documents to which they refer, I can hardly "believe that reference to the files will he facilitated.
Minutes arc sometimes written on slips of papers, on drafts of letters, or even on the documents themselves. In such cases it would not he possible to maintain the minutes in complete chronological order cn the left hand side of the jacket. The green sheets which arc connected with every important document added to an 2 file, and which arc used for the writing of minutes, serve, without douht, tc keep the papers in the 2 file in order ana render easier the task of reference to any particular paper in the file. They could hardly he abolished, i.e., because they are also used for docketing and in connection with the inclusion of important additions to 2 files in the Laily Synopsis.
I think, therefore, that they could as well he used for writing minutes cn. Besides, it is sometimes not quite easy to decide if a memorandum is to he regarded as a minute or as a letter forming part of the correspondence; that will not make any difficulty if the minutes are to he connected with the correspondence in the file, hut such a paper will of course he rather difficult to find if the minutes and the correspondence axe to he kept separated*•

Professor Attolioo,
Under Score tary-G-cmoral for Internal Services.
I beg tc forward to you a copy of ray minute of August 10th to the Registrar, as well as a copy of his reply of the 11th, relating to the use of Z files*
I should he grateful if this question could bo put on the agenda of a Directors1 Looting at the convenient of the Score tary-G-eneral. Perhaps it would be useful to let the Directors have an advance copy of the documents, so that they may to prepared for discussion.
Ly own opinion, after having read H. Gihlrs paper, is that wc have not as yet found the absolutely ideal solution, I should think that if certain of the other large Sections with very extensive correspondence have no objection to the present system, the reason may be that they do not send their documents to the Registry to the same extent as I do,	Indeed, to judge from the
Daily Synopsis, some of these Sections have practically no correspondence at all. Perhaps they have evaded the Z file difficulty by establishing their own files and not forwarding the documents to the Registry? If, as I think we ought, we file all regular correspondence in the Registry, and not in the Sections, it would help to have the Z file question settled to everybody1s satisfaction.

Gonfidential Circular
8 (a) 19 26 .
Kota by tho Secretary- General,
With rofcronca to Confidential Circular 8, 1926, tho attcohed note by Dr. Rajchman is circulated. No othor observations on Confidential Ciroulur 0 have boon rocoivod by tho Socrotary-Genoral.
Tho quest ion raised in that Circular will bo discussed at the Directors1 Mooting to be hold on June 30th.
The Secretary-General,
With regard to Confidential Circular 8, 1926, tho views of the Health Section with regard to X filos are as follows
a)	In ordor that each file should present in proper sequence tho history of its subject, it is desirable that any minute sheet required should bo inserted next to and above the document or series of documents to which tho first minute thereon refers and should remain there, subsequent minutes with reference to tho question raised being added on the samo sheet.
b) To preserve chronological order it seems advisable to amend, tho standing orders of tho Registry in order to allow af ninuto shoots being inserted between incoming and outgoing letters when necessary; tho sonse ox the latter will often depend upon minutes arising out of tho former.
o) To avoid to some extent tho objection raised by Mr. Colban, it is suggested that minute shoots should be more freely inserted as and when required and that tho same shoot should not be used for minutes which do not arise out of the first on that particular sheet d) The writing of minutes of importance on slips of paper has obvious objections and should bo avoided as much as posable: any annotation on filed documents themselves should bo restricted to such remarks as "No action" "Soon" etc.
-2-
■j) It is essential that the Registry should file inooming and outgoing corrospondonco in propor chronological soquonoo oven if - for reasons which arc often unavoidable - they aro not always received in tho registry in that order.

Confidential Circular 11.1926
The attached lleno rancLuin, which has been written by Hr. V/ilson, raises certain problems and advances certain considerations of the greatest interest.	Without expressing myself at present
either in favour or against what he suggests, I thinf: the document is well worth the attention of Undersecretaries, birectors and Chiefs of Section.
I therefore circulate it üO "CÍ-lL/uÍI with a view to ultimate discussion in the Directors1 Heeting after the holidays. As the Question involved is of great importance, the meeting had better bo some time in August. Meanwhile, if anyone has any observations to offer, I should be glad if they v,culd do so so that these could also be circulated.	The latin-
óme rican Bureau should also have a copy (I would like one for my own use too) for consideration.
(Initialled) a.D.

THE 3E0HETABY-SE1ERAL
- 2 -
I have noticed from recent numbers of the "Press Review" that the question is being considered in various quarters whether the withdrawal of Brazil from the League may not be the beginning of a movement which will end by the League becoming, lor all practical purposes, a Bur ope an League. Some writers indicate that the means of conciliating the interests of the League as a world organisation and its special duties towards Europe is a problem which it would now be well for the League as a whole to examine.
In view of these expressions of opinion I wish
to put forward a few considerations on this matter further
to those which I advanced in my minute to you of \pril 20th,
of which I attach a copy for reference. I an moved to do
so particularly bp the fact that the leading article in
the June number of the "Round Table" deals with this
problem, though without suggesting the lines of a possible
solution. It is perhaps significant that the "Round
Table" should pay special attention to it, as even if
others might regard the Europeanisation of the League with
only mild regret, people interested in the preservation of
some hind of British unity can hardly do so. I quote a
passage from the article
"\7e feel sure that the earlier vision of the League as an instrument fer uniting: all nations in a league of peace and annity will be lost, unless it is recognised that the veto of Brazil is a symptom of some tiling far wider than the amour nr oar e of Brazil herself, that, a challenge has been thro. n dO’~n to the dominance of Europe in the League and to the preoccupation of the

KJ
League with Europe, which must he taken into account, and that the course 01 wisdom is to recognise that the only line of development for the League is gradually to distinguish hetv/een its method, of handling the internal affairs of Europe or of any other region, and the larger problems which axe of world concern."
As I have explained once before, I personally think that the roblem. is a real one and also that a reasonable solution should not be difficult to find. To my uino. the difficulty is not at all that the machinery of the league should be used to deal with a large number cf purely European problems, but that there is at present no recognition of the fact that these questions are merely European and have, therefore, not the same claim on the interest of the members of the League as a whole as other questions. The complaints that the League is only interested in Europe would, I think, disappear if the organs of the League showed that they recognised the difference between the two kinds of question, while continuing to deal with both; for, interesting and important as certain purely European questions dealt with by the League are to Europe,
tv' r~ V	are very much	the smaller part of the Le	ague !	's work.
« i • -C-13	would, be seen	if they were no longer tre	ci qy	on the sam
plane with more general questions, whereas without such lisci imination the preoccupation of the League with Europe is
:c be exaggerated.
The Council, while reserving the right to deal in 'nil session with any question on its agenda should need arise, night establish the practice whereby what may be called ’'European administrative” questions should, not merely for reasons J î convenience but in recognition of the regional character of 3uch questions, normally7 do dealt with otherwise than oy the lull Council.	Such questions - to make a quite provisional list -
4
’70iilcl seen to "be those concerning the Saar, Dansig, minorities, Hungary, Q-reeco, Bulgaria, Memo 1 (nor? that the larger iiemcl question has teen solved). Naturally, as the Council has
accepted obligations in those mat to approve the action to be ta>en normally a acre formality. Hy
tors, is would have ultincitely , but this should become point is that these questions
and others liha them which may arise are strictly European
questions. They are not of interest to the League as a
whole as a threat of war between two ¡¡embers, even if both w
European, is oi interest to the League. I should say this
even of Minorities, the Saar and Danzig. formally the Council is the protector or guarantor, but it seems to me that, in fact, the effective guarantor or protector is Luropcan rather than world public opinion and, indeed, that it is more in beeping with the dignity of ¡furope that these questions should bo treated currently by the European members of the Council only, unless, of course, thoe >-cre to become so acuto- as to involve the operation of Article II, or wore otherwise deemed to require consideration by the full Council. I-admit that a Saar question arouses as a rule more interest at the Council than say, an opium question, and it may well be ashed why the full Council should deal with the Persian Opium Enquiry, but not with, the question of foreign troops in the Saar.
I-Iy answer would be that the Council can hardly apply the regional principle to non-European questions until it has more to deal with, as it may in time have as regards Asia and other regions. At present it is only as regards Europe that the Council is dealing with a number of questions which, involving Gw tailed administrative worh over a long period, and presenting for a wo 11-defined, geographical group of nations an interest far exceeding that which the; hav- lor nations outside that group, are suitable for "regional" treatment. ,
I do not wigh in this Minute to enter into the bigger problems of the regional question, for instance, the application of the principle to agreements for security and the reduction of armaments, but to consider only that class of questions which, for lack of a better term, I have called "administrative".
If the views set forth above wore accepted, the Council might proceed by one of two methods:
1) The Council night extend the present system of Council Committees so that all the "European administrative" questions could be dealt with by such Committees. This would mean Committees for the Saar end Danzig and for such Memel questions as may be placed on the agenda of the Council. This would	not appear to be a very radical change	but	it is
implied in	the line of argument adopted that	none	but	the
European members of the Council should sit on these Committees. I ta!:e it this would not be an important change as regards European financial questions (Hungary, Greece, etc.) but it would be as regards Minorities questions.	I can quite see
that the assistance of non-European members in the solution of some of	these questions may, in the past,	have	been very
groat, but	1 am proceeding on the assumption	that	any	possible
sacrifices entailed by the proposed change would be out’ oighed by the advantages to the League as a whole of treating those .questions as purely European. If agreement could not bo obtained in the "regional" committee, the matter could always bo referred to the full Council, so that the mediating influence of the non-nuropcan members of the Council would bo available.	However, is it not possible that the European
members would in time develop the suae- tradition that it is up to them to agree which to some extent animates the Council as a whole?	The object of those proposals is to emphasise
6
the universal character oi the League, tut it would be to the good if thereby a European sense mas incidentally developed among the European memoers of the Council.
2)	The Council might constitute all its European members as a European Committee dealing v:ith all the questions indicated. This would advertise better than any other method the Council's desire to distinguish between its regional and its general business, but naturally would be a mere radical chang-e.
It would be open to this or these Committees tc meet in public, and to keep full records, and any member should be able to require that the matter should be brought before the full Council.
It seems to me that by thus recognising that some of its business was of European interest only, the Council would emphasise its belief that the main business of the League concerned the world as a whole. It v'ould be seen that by far the greater part oi the Council’s agenda did, in fact, deal ■ nth questions of more than European interest and that all the worn which it did in direct application of
■v" )
the Covenant belonged to this class oi larger questions. Moreover, belong long the Council might find itself dealing, primarily through a Committee consisting oi - say - Japan, China, Chile, Trance, Great Britain and Lolland, with some regional question interesting another - and non-Luropean -group o j_ me mbers of the League (the Pacific Croup).
The attached copies of some recent Council agendas show that the work which would be treated as regional is comparatively small. The "European administrative" questions are bx ache ted and. marked "E".
7
A corresponding procedure might in time be found useful as regards the merican aspect of questions before the League. However, I do not wish to advocate any schematic division of the .Aembers of the League into regions. It is only in response to immediate practical needs that the regional principle should be applied, and it is only as regards certain .European questions that a need can be said already to exist.
If any value is attached to these proposals, they might be put forward, after a certain amount oi private discussion anong both European and non-European delegates, by an influential delegate in the assembly’s debate on the ir,orh of the Council, provided always that Germany was admitted to the League at the beginning of the Assembly. Obviously in such a matter both the Council and the Assembly should agree.
If it were clearly explained that the questions to be treated normally as regional would bo really of a regional character and that they could at any moment be brought before the full Council, I cannot imagine that non-European delegates would feel that the adoption of the regional principle as applying to l^urope in the first place would diminish the importance of the non-European Members of the League, It would be realised that, on the contrary, non-European Members would gain from the change, because though they would lose the doubtful advantage of having a regular say In matters which only by a generous hyperbole could be considered as of more than European concern, they would sit on a Council which dealt almost exclusively with matters of common concern to the Members of the League as a y:hc le.

Confidential Circular 15.1926
IIQTE BY TUB SEd£Z£J:Y--(EEEBl.L.
On July let, I circulated to Under-SecrGtarJres-Gkmeral, Directors and Chefs de Service a memorandum v/ritten by Hr» V/ilson regarding the treatment by the Council of certain questions which he describes as "European" . (Confidential Circular 11.1926 ). fue memorandum has given rise to a series of very interesting observations from various Sections of the Secretariat.
In view of the opinions expressed, I hardly think it necessary to discuss the question further even at a Directors meeting.
I am of opinion that whatever may be the ultimate constitutional changes in the League structure which force of circumstances nay prove desirable, it would be a grave mistake to bring such an issue to the fore at the present time or in the near future*
It would open uj) all kinds of grave problems which had much better remain untouched..
The present situation may not be perfect, but it is accepted by everyone and that is an enormous asset. Personally I an by no means convinced that change is desirable, oven if it were easy to obtain without danger, which it certainly is not.
I feel sure, however , that the Under Secretaries and Directors will like to see those papers, but, as they are voluminous, I hardly think that the onroense of roneoing and distribution would be justified. T^oy have therefore been filed for circulation.
(Initialled) 3. D.
Confidential Circular 16, 19
august 31st, 1926.
A meeting, at which Monsieur ¿vend, professor Attolico, Monsieur Colban and Monsieur Comert and the Secrotary-General wore present, was held this morning in order to discuss Mr.
Colban’s report to the Secretary-General and a note by tho latter with regard to the best action to be taken in order to strengthen the relations of the Latin-rmerican Republics with the League, both in regard to the position inside and outside the Secretariat.
It did. not seem desirable in the general interests ox the league that any spocial treatment should be accorded to the Latin American states as a whole. Such a policy would be contrary to the general desires of the Latin American delegates as expressed at consecutive Assemblies. Therefore each Section of the Secretariat should consider and deal with such Latin American questions as fall within its particular sphere. It was agreed that it was important that the Sections should devote more attention than heretofore to seeing whether there were not questions relating to specific states in Latin ¿merica which could be studied with a view to ultimate action. It was felt that this was particularly the case in the technical field, Of course it was understood that no final action could be initiated unless on the request of some in tin American country Itself.
The Lections particularly concerned seemed to be the Oconomic and finance, the Health, the Section of Intellectual Cooperation, the Transit Section and the social Section. It was thought on the whole that the time had now come or would shortly
- s-
arrive when the Latin American Bureau as such should be abolished. It was recognised, however, that the services rendered by Monsieur Rodriguez to the various Latin hmeriosn Delegates were of great value, and should be continued. . perhaps, howovor, ho might bo attached to the Section doaling with Protocol ouostions and continue hie functions in that capacity. At the same time, it was fully recognised that there should be fined periodic meetings of all the Latin nme:ican members of the Secretariat. This number would shortly bo considerably increased. Such meetings would be hold undor rhe presidency of the Secretary-General. 'They might be fined for the first Friday of each month. The agenda would be the discussion of any problems which could be hold to affect fa tin America as a whole, and the considoration of the views of the Sections ihich load doalt v/ith any problems specially affecting a particular Latin American Republic. Such meetings should, whenever practicable, be attended by the various Under-Secretaries and Directors. It was hoped that they would be also used in order that suggestions might be conveyed by the different members of the Secretariat coming from Latin American countries as to subjects which corld mos'c profitably be treated by the various Sections of the Secretariat.	It was unanimously
agreed that it would bo satisfactory if one of the Secretaries to the SocrctarywG-enoral, say Lr. ilson, could prepare the agenda and act as secretary of these monthly meetings.
-3-
As to the strengthening of t he Information work in the ..i ffereiit he publics of Latin nmerica, the advisability of sending special lecturers to Latin America from outside the Secretariat was diseased and rejected.
On the other hand, it was felt that each member coming from Latin America to the Secretariat might well advise in writing the Information Section in respect of his own country and the lines on which the work could be carried out. A considerable amelioration was loomed for from the system of correspondents and from that of engaging Latin American journalists for important meetings of the League, such as the Council and the Assembly, members coming from Latin America might be encouraged ’"'hen they went on leave to devote part of their time, perhaps by means of special arrangements^, to information work in that country. It was recognised that- a visit from some high official of the Secretariat to some of the Latin American. (Countries mi ,-t ..rove- of considerable value, but the detailed consideration of this point was left over for further discussion.
It was clear that the proposals put forward would require a re-arrangement of the 1927 budget. But as the provisions of the budget falling under the Latin American Bureau would be required in just the sane way for the new programme, it was thought unnecessary to male any changes at such a late moment.
The proposal was made that it would be of use to arrange for meetings in Latin America from time to time of different organs of the League, and it was agreed that this was desirable provided the expense involved was not

Heads oi 3 sc lion*____	QJiuYji, October 22nd, 1926,
If GTE BY 'JH-lu o AC ALT ---HI - GAN Eh aL
I should like an early Directors’ Meeting to discuss the ruesiion oi the time which should be allowed ior reply in circular letters to Members of the League.
The attached letter of 7th June 1926 from the Irime Minister of Lew ^ealanu shews that requests for replies are sometimes made which it is materially impossible for more distant Members of the League to fulfil within the time given. My own impression is that cases of this kind are not rare.
There seem to me to be two alternative ways of regarding the problem:
On the one hand, there is what may be described as the strictly administrative view, that enough time should always be allowed for the most distant Members of the League to consider any letter or questionnaire and send a reply. This, in practice, would mean that no reply on a matter requiring serious consideration should be asked for in less than 5 months, or, in exceptional circumstanoes, 4 months, from the date of the despatch of the letter from the Secretariat.
I	(This would leave 2 months aid 1 month respectively
for action in the capitals of the most distant countries), Naturally, if ’within the framework of this general principle measures can be devised for treating certain
•-£-
questions on a continental "basis (as was done in the c.oe oi the European Conference on Carnage Measurements in Inland navigation), the . eriod could "be shorter»
In support oi this general view it may he contended that, since the League is a world-wide organisation, progress in its work must "be enpeoted to be slower than if it were, say. a European organisation. There is also the reason that it is annoying to distant Members of the League which are disposed to take the oecre'n r ijt' s re uests seriously, to receive letters such as the one to which I have referred. I do not know if many Members of the League feel this annoyance, but two at any rate (Australia and New Zealand) have unofficially drawn my attention to the matter.
On the other hand, there is what may be called the practical view that speed in the League’s work is the most important consideration and that, as replies from practically all the Members of the League, including those whose opinions count for most in the determination of policy, should be obtainable within two or three months, it is formalistic to allow a longer period.	This view is all the more plausible
in that, if one excepts the distant courtries which, either have representation in Euro, e, or seldom reply substantially to the letters or cueoticnuaires of the Secretariat, very few countries remain.
In any case, it would seem right chat sections drafting letters a*kin,:, for a reply within a short
3-
period should he careful to use the wcr els "if possible" in connection with their rec.uests.	M oreover, it
may sometimes be found peso ibie to telegraph to distant countries having no representation in Uurope, the substance of ruestionnaires. Uliis, hcwvver, would often be difficult owing to the expense involved.
It will be realised, thc^c this whoxe 1 u6tioxij apart from ito general bearing, will be of special importance when the Council is ca lied upon to ask for the observations of Governments on the reports; of the !r eparatory Committed for the hconomic Conference and the Disarmament Conference.

ROTE BY SeCi&TAEY-GEDERAL.
It has occurred to me for some time past that, although the system ox sending the Council Agenda to the Acting President of the Council ior approval has up to non worked comparatively well, it is not really logical, and might at some future time lead to difficulties.
To my mind, the proper procedure would he that the Agenda should he approved hy the member of the Council who is to act as President at the next meeting.
There seem to he three different courses possible
1)	The continuance of the present system.
2)	That all questions relating to work arising out
of the past session should ho considered hy the Acting President hut questions relating to the next session hy the President designate.-(The disadvantage of this system is that we are not always certain who the next President will he).
3)	That the out-going president should -preside over
the opening meeting of the next Council till such time as the Agenda had been aoopted, and that he should then give place to the new President.
(This would avoid the disadvantage attached to (2), and it would give somewhat more formality to the installation of the now President).
At the same time, it does not scorn altogether consequent that the
Agenda should be approved en bloc by one President, and that the
subjects should then he discussed in detail under the Presidency
of another member of the Council.
I realise that, as the t u latter courses to which I
have referred present certain difficulties, it may be wiser to
leave matters as they now stand.
I think, however, that we might well discuss the matter
at a future Directors meeting; I circulate this note for that
purpose

Confidential Circular 20. 1926
PRESENT PRACTICE OF THE SECRETARIAT REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS TO THE ASSEMBLY, THE COUNCIL AND OTHER ORGANS OF THE LEAGUE.
Note by the Secretary-General.
It has been suggested to me by the Economic Section that it might be useful if a note were drawn up setting forth the existing rules as regards the transmission to the Council of communications addressed to it, especially communications from individuals and private organisations.
The Council has definitely laid down the procedure to be followed only in the case of certain classes of communications. It would seem, therefore, that what is needed is a document indicating not orily the rules which exist, but the practice followed by the Secretariat, so far as it can be defined, in cases not governed by rules. The attached memorandum has therefore been prepared, not as a direction to the several Sections of the Secretariat, but as a summary description of the present practise, as regards both the Assembly and the Council v/hich may be of some use for purposes of general reference.
(Initialled) E.D.
3rd November 1926.

I.
The right of requiring that a. matter be communicated to the Council is usually held to belong exclusively to the Government of a ¿¿ember of the League or - for ouch is the cas* in practice - of any duly constituted State. Naturally this right is £.130 enjoyed, within the limits of their competence, by the autonomous organisations, by any committee which reports to the Council,by League Commissioners appointed by the Council and by the Secretary-General.
This general rule is at present subject to the following qualifications:
(a) In certain international treaties duties have been laid on the League the acceptance of which by the Council has had, as a necessary legal consequence, or as a practically convenient result, the transmission to the Council of communications not emanating from Governments. As each communication addressed to the Council under reference to a treaty provision is considered by the Section of the Secretariat concerned it would be of little interest to the Secretariat in general to enumerate all the cases in which such communications may be accepted. However, there may be cited as instances the transmission to the Council of the annual report of the Straits Settlement Commission and the communication to the Members of the Counci I, in accordance with rules laid do?/n by the Council, of minority petitions and petitions from the inhabitants of the Saar Territory. A special procedure has been laid d07/n by the Council for petitions from mandated territories.
3
(b)	In certain cases the Secretary-General has circulated to the Council other communications, e.g., from the hed Cross Organisations (because of the special position accorded to them under Article 25 of the Covenant) and from tin-Holy See (because of its special diplomatic status). Specie! consideration would aloe naturally be given tc a request for communication to the Council by an Internation&l Bureau placed, under the direction of the League in accordance with Article 24 of the Covenant.
(c)	The treatment which should be accorded to communications from non-official international organisations
is laid down in a resolution of the Council of December 10th, 1923
Otherwise the Secretary-General does not normally consider himself authorised to transmit a communication to the Council or inform the Council that a communication has been received.
It is for the Section concerned to reply to the author of the request in such form as may be thought proper to the circumstances of the particular case. In some cases a signed letter explaining the constitutional difficulty is sent, in others, a third person communication containing some such formula as
".......The Secretary-General regrets that, under
the existing rules, he is not authorised to submit to the Council of the League of Nations communications from non-off ici'-l organisations or individuals - . .
Sometimes the subject of a request is outside the competence of the League, and its author is so informed.
4
In certain exceptional cases (e.g.communications from persons who are clearly in an unbalanced state of mind), it is thought best to send no reply at all.
*	i'r
It may be useful to mention here that certain principles to be observed by the Secretariat, if asked by a Government to transmit to the Council or Members of the League a communication which might cause serious offence to another Government, are set forth in a discussion held by the Directors' meeting on April 29th 192G.
II.
The circulation of communications to the Assembly is made only as the result of an official request er preceding decision of the Assembly.
It has, however, become the custom to publish in the Journal of the Assembly a cammunication submitted annually by the Federation of Societies for the League of Nations. In each case a special resolution of the General Committee has sanctioned this publication.
5y virtue cf a resolution adopted by the General Committee on September 11th 1924, a reference to the source and. subject of a communication from a non-official international organisation may be inserted in the Journal of the Assembly.
(There is a minute by the Secretary General on nonofficial communications addressed to the Assembly in File 26/54593/54593x)
5
III.
It would seem to be unnecessary to attempt to define the existing practice as regards communication to the various League committees.as this is of little interest except to the Sections severally concerned. Nor is there any need to draw attention to the informal action which is sometimes taken by the Secretariat, e.g., reference to the Prasiden (of the Council or a Committee) of a communication of exceptional interest.-
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
Confidential Circular 21.1926.
For the Directors' meeting:
The question has been raised as to whether it is possible or desirable to lay down a general rule to the effect that in all cases where (a) any official person, or (b) any private person comes to Geneva on the convocation of the Secretariat for work connected with the League, his Government should be informed of the fact by the Secretariat. I propose to appoint a small Committee to consider and report on this question, after taking into consideration the various ways in which such cases normally occur, e.g., appointments in the Secretariat, visits of unofficial experts, meetings of sub-Committees whether consisting of officials or otherwise, etc. etc.
I would propose to constitute this Committee as f oliows: -

IaZMQ to the SEC? . ET ARY-GEUER.AL*
A few weeks ago, at my return fr cm e mission to the Hague I
mentioned in conversation with you that the municipal government of
Amsterdam was considering the possibility of inviting the Economic
Cohiorence to meet in that city. Last week I was privately informed
that the municipality has acme to a definite decision in this matter,
and that nogocistions are going on between Amsterdam end the Hague on
the subject. I do not yet know what is going to bo the ^ titude of the Hague authorities, but I have some reason to believe that it will be
s favourable one.
Under those circumstances the two Dutch members of the Preparatory Committee for the Economic Conference, Lir . Xrdllcr and rnr. Gudege est, thought wiso to enquire in a discrete way among the members of this Committee whether a Dutch initiative of the kind mentioned above, would eventually meet with sympathy. Their general/lmprcssion wqs,that those members of the Committee who are since several years in the habit of
coning to Geneva, although not formulating any concrete objection against /mis ter dam, rather prefer to have the c o nf erenoe at the seat of
the League than meeting elsewhere. Several other members however,
especially those whose membership of the Preparatory Committee brought
thorn for the first time to Geneva, rather thought that it might be a
good idea to have the Economic Conference in a big economic centre
like Amsterdam.	.-.t the same time I asked for the opinion of a few
friends in the Secretariat,and as a whole I rather found them willing
to consider favourably an eventual Dutch invitation.
As far as my two countrymen and I mys elf could gather the arguments of those who would look favourably upon Amsterdam as meeting
place for the economic conference, are the following:
1° They like the idea to have this conference in a city like .misterdam, which represents one of the world’s important shipping, trading
o
— (J ~
and "bi? nting centres; with, easy and direct telegraph and telephone c cornu ii oat ion with tho principal capitals of ¿trope, They drev; attention to tho fact that naatordem can ha reached in a few hours by aeroplane fr an London, Laris, Bala, Vienna,
Berlin end tho Scandinavian countries, a no. that it is linked up directly Toy telephone with a big wireless station covering not only Europe hut also the amorican continent and the Bar Last.
Several members of the Committee expressed the opinion the t this was not only important for the success of the Conference, hut also fr om the point of view of many businessmen who would like to assist, hut who would like -at the same time to romp.in in easy c aaau nice tic n with their affairs. ¿Iran tho point of
view of the Conference they apparently wore of the opinion
that the argument mentioned above had a double effect:
c_ - the atmosphere of a city like muster clam might favourably influence the Conference;
bp- having the Conference in Amsterdam would usefully
moot the objection of many critics, vh o always pretend that the results achieved in Geneva, apecially in the economic field, risk to bo blown to pieces as soon as they get into touch with reality.
Another advantage of having the Conference outside Geneve would in tho opinion of the people consulted, to give it a standing of its own, thus marking it ms a great event in the economic records of the'world. It was pointed out the t this consideration had proved to be of special value in the case cx tho Brussels financial conference* "Eho'T Brussels Conference means to everybody the beginning of financial r aeons truotion. "The" Amsterdam Conference would mean in the future the beginning of a new development in the economic area, while in tho case the oonfcrenco was hell iptbjnto it would only be one out of a long list,
-3-
3°	Considering that the participating countries will he
invited to send a delegation of five men, that owing tr the intricate and complicated character of economic problems, the number of experts per delegation will probably bo a fairly considerable one, it seems justified to expect tho Conference to be biggor than an ordinary assembly6 Now the Salle de la Reformation gives hardly sufficient spaoe for an Assembly, and the only other big suitable meeting-hall in Geneva, the Bailment Electoral, apart from tho fact that it has a very bad acoustic, has boon reserved already for the Labour Conference, whioh is going to be opened on May 27th, and which necessitates a fortnight beforehand extensive modifications of the building. To this is to bo added that the Committees of the Economic Conference will also bo bigger than those of the assembly, as very probably every delegate will take one or more exports with him to the Committee meetings.
Under those oiroumstances the question arises whether the Conference can be comfortably housed in Cone to . In Amsterdam to the contrary we would probably have tho choico between two suitable buildings, large enough to give shelter to the full
| conference, to the committee meetings and to the secretariat. It would be necessary of course to gather detailed particulars about these buildings on the spot.
To certain members of the Preparatory Committee and to a few colleagues in the Secretariat the fact that a Russian Delegation, might officially or unofficially come to Amsterdam ’while they would not come to Geneva, seemed to be an argument in favour of Amsterdam, hut opinions on this point were not unanimous. The same can bo suid about American participation; as certain people seem to be of the opinion that bolding the Conference outside Geneva would make it easier for the American Government to accept an invitation; other People on the contrary expressed the view that this would not be of
I
influence whatever.

/

4 -
The I Iain objection which was formulated against Ans ter dan was that the Secretariat, lax iron its headquarters would work under less favourable circumstances than in Geneva. This is of course a point which other people in the Secretariat,
with more experience of its general working, can judge bettor than I. My personal impression is however that the consolidation of the Secretariat-organisation and its strong sense of duty seems to me sufficient guarantee that it would be easy to overcome eventual handicaps which might result from holding the Conference outside Geneva.
Another objection might be that the cost of the Conference outside Geneva is considerably higher than that of the Conference held at the seat of the League, but if the L'utch Government invites the Conference to come to Amsterdam, this difficulty would probably be met by an offer to pay for the surplus costs.
finally I would like to remark that since the foundation of the League no League conference of any importance was ever held in Holland. This economic Conference would appeal particularly to hutch mentality, and most probably prove to be one of the very best means of League propaganda I can imagine.

I should like the following points to be considered at a Directors* meeting:
The Secretariat frequently receives communications from individuals or organisations asking that the Secretary-General should take action at the in: or organisations which he is not c description of the practice follov to requests of this kind, which a: submitted to the Council or other organ of on pages 3 and 4 of Confidential Circular 20, 1926.
The point which seems to me to call for special consideration is what reply, if any, should be sent to the writers of communications of an inflammatory nature, e.g., communication: attacking the Government of a I-,’ember of the League in violent language.
One of three courses is possible :
1)	to send a reply (which would normally be in the third person) stating th; competent in the matter;
2)	to send a formal printed acknowledgment o: receipt (see form attaci

Note by the Treasurer.
Following a discussion I had this morning with Professor Attolico, the Under Secretary-General in charge of Internal Administration requested me to inform Directors and Heads of Services that he would only authorise transfers from one sub-head to another of the same item of the budget in cases where it was clears evident that circumstances unforeseen at the time when the budget was drawn up rendered such a procedure essential; all requests for internal transfers should therefore be accompanied by the fullest explanations regarding the merits of the case put forward by the Section concerned.

Geneva, December 7th, 1926.
IJOTIi EY TKA SSCBBTAfiY-GLI&RAL.
I should like tho DirectorsT Meeting to consider at an early date the question of members of the Secretariat addressing public nestings. Apart from this general question, I would like special attention to be given to the point whether, and, if so, to what extent, members of the Secretariat should speak of tho work of the League as a whole, instead of that part of it with which they themselves are specially acquainted.
Although, of course, there are a net inconsiderable number of cases in which members of the Secretariat would be capable of speaking on subjects primarily dealt with by Sections other than their own - and this of course applies in a particular degree to the Information Section - it is at least safe to lay down that a member of the Secretariat ought not tc speak about aspects of the League's work on which he does not feel himself to be thoroughly informed.
But this lands us in something cf a dilemma, since there can be no doubt that any large general audience wants to hear about the work of the League in its largest aspect and at the same time in any particular aspects which have been for any reason specially before the public at the time. Such an audience may be disappointed to hear an address confined to the work of one Section; and it may receive a misleading impression of the nature, extent and importance of the activities of the League taken as a whole,
There is tho
9
further point that such audiences usually line to bo allowed to as it questions on all league affairs. These last

BUGLiED TO IrTVIT.-TIClTS TO COUIi’ZEIHCSS,
I should like to consider at a Directors1 Heating the question whether it is po-ssiole to improve on present procedure in regard tc invitations received by the Secretariat to send representatives to international congresses of various kinds*
Such invitations are at present passed on by the registry according to their character either to the International Bureaux Saotion or t o the Information Section or tc a particular Section whose work has special affinity with the object of the Conference The Section receiving the invitation does, no doubt, in most cases consult any other Section which may be interested, but cases have occurred when such consultation has hot taken place» It has been suggested to me that it is desirable to
try	ar.d avoid		the	recurrence	of such oases	and further to	have
one	Section	in	the	Seere tar is	it which keeps	a general view	of the
invitât ions	race	ived	an d the	action taken-	If this	is so,	it
seems clear	that	the	Section	chosen for the	purpose	shouid	be
the Information Section»
x possible arrangement, therefore, would be that all official invitations should be sent by the li eg is try in tne first place to the Information Section, which would submit a draft reply to me after consulting all the Sections concerned* ¿arrangements will, of course, have to be made in the Section for answers to be sent promptly to all invitations and for a complete list to be kept regularly up-to-date of invitations received and the action talien on them*

ITote X;/ the oecretar/-Genera 1.
.s? c result of discussions with Latin . jnerican delegatee to the Seventh -.srenbly and of the resolution of the letter with regard, to the Latin jnerican Bn lean, it is necessary to re consider the question ox the official and "liaison’’ v/ork of the oecretarint as regards the Republics >■£ Latin .jnerica.
1.	The Latin .jnerican Bn ream will he suppressed as from the 1st January, 1927; from that date the expression
"Latin .jnerican Bureau,r will cease to be used in all
documents in current circulation in the be c ret aria t.
2.	Official communications will c xtinue to be sent
to	the La	tin .jnerican	Kepublics,	Ly	].e tters, te le grams ,
ci rcular s		, etc., e tc . ,	in French	or	■n glish, s is re d b y me
or	on my	beha Lx by the	D ire c to rs	of	th e Le c t io n e c one e me d ,
according to the general rules in force .	. 1 th o u gh c~och
correspondence is usually couched in the sane terms for Latin .jnerican and for non-Latin -jnerican countries it may be advisable, in very special cases, that the Latin jnerican member or members of the Section concerned should be consulted with regard to the letters intended for Latin American states. If the Latin .'jnerican member of the Lection is absent, the Director in much special cases nay have recourse to a Latin .jnerican member of a different Lection, whom he may select at his own discretion,
-2
3.	Liaison work is executed by means of pers cru-1 con— t-cts c.nd of unoff isie 1, personal _n& c cni i dentit 1 correspondence The object of such work is to develop and fortify the relations existing between the League and. its members » It is therefore
likely to be more effective when in charge of nationals of each country. Subject- to this previso, the work of liaison with
Latin America will he entrusted as a whole to nationals of Latin American states, who may at any time he in the Secretariat; but in order to establish a proper division of this v;crk the following principles should he observed
(a) Any personal or confidential action c cnceming Colombia will normally he entrusted to Monsieur Cespedes; Guatemala to Monsieur Bertholin; Panama to Monsieur Rodriguez; Uruguay to Monsieur llogueira; Venezuela to Monsieur Arocha, e tc *, etc?
fb) The Latin . xierican member or members of the particular Section concerned will he responsible, under the authority of the Director of the Section, for unofficial letters as may he desirable for liaison work, when such letters, which will for the most part he v/ritten in Spanish, are to take the same form fen the whole or the greater part of Latin America. The other Latin American members of the Secretariat will in every such case he consulted with regard to the respective countries.- Bor the proper amplication of this principle, the present distribution
of the various La tin-Auer i can members including temporary members of the different Sections of the Secretariat should he
borne in mind
M. Arocha (Venezuelian ) in the Disarmament Section.
II. Cespedes (Colombian) in the I Tin or i ties Section.
M. Rogueira (Uruguayan)	) In the
II. Bertholin (Guatemalian)	) Inioxmation
M. Guttierrez Grander (Bolivian) ) Section.
M. Garcia Palacios (Chilian)	)
M. Porto (Argentine)	in the Economic and Financial
Section.
M. Rodriguez (Panamanian) will remain as general liaison
officer with Latin America.
For this purpose he will he at the disposal of the Directors and Heads of Service of the following Sections:-Commnni cations .and Transit, Social Legal, Mandates, Health, Intellectual C o-operation and the internal -administration generally (until such time as a Latin—-merican member enters the Secticn).
Monsieur Rodriguez will, of course, consult his Latin-. meric an colleagues of the other Sections with regard to any unofficial letters which he may have to send to their respective countries .
(c)	If the sole Latin—meri can member of any Section be absent, his duties will be assumed by some other La tin-American member of another Section, after consultation between the Directors of the two sections concerned. The duties of the absent member in respect of personal or confidential correspondence, and the revision of letters intended for his own country will be taken over by one of his colleagues previously nominated by him, with the consent of the Director ccncemed.
Monsieur Rodriguez being entrusted with the liaison
work of various sections, special arrangements will he made when he is absent. Ee will he replaced, as regards unofficial work,
by some other Latin American member of a section in which there
are more than one of these nationals. -S regards personal c or.
tacts with Latin Ameri can Ministers, en-deXegates , etc. iron his previous functions as Executive becrofcary of the
resulting Latin-

e rr c h a ri engene nts , so that requests will make the le t t er s f o r Pa nama.
(d)	Latin-.jneri can nembers of Sections nay request
Monsieur Rodriguez to desnatch documents relative to the League
asked for by persons in their respective countries, to reply
to questions 'out to then and to furnish reports desired; Monsieur Hodriguez will do his utmost to meet such requests
subject to his work of liaison with the different Sections.
4.	Phe Secretary-General will call a meeting of the Latin-
.American members of the Secretariat on the first Prod ay of each
month, at ¿5.30 p.n. Phe meeting will be open to all Undersecretaries-General, Directors and Heads of Service and to ary
member of the Secretariat authorized by his chief to attend.
sir. Wilson , or in hie absenc ■ a member of the Secretariat
selected b'T the Secret:: ry -General, will convoke the meeting not
later than the preceding day, and take the minutes of the meeting.
At this regular meeting or at such special meetings as might in
emergencies be convoked by the Secretary- Genera 1, views might b-exchanged should the occasion arise w. th regard to the choice of personalities in Latin- merican countries for expert committees and sub-c com it tees as participants in missions organised by the League for study, etc., etc. fhere will a.Iso be placed on the agendof thn meeting such special items as will have been ccmmuni.

6.	All prop os tic or suggestions made by a La tin -am or i can
member of Section relating to official or liaison natters concerning the > action will be addressed to the Director or Head, of Section.
As in the case of other members of the Secretariat, it is understood that Da tin-.^merican members of Section will be entitled to address themselves to the Secreta-General or to the Under Secretaries-General in any question of a purely personal character,

Heferiing to the discussion at the Directors'meeting ox October 20th, 1926, on the . .ss-emblyT s renu-ast for further economy in the production of the minutes of league committees and sub-committees, I think that the attached note by h. Enas showing the practice followed by the Transit Section might be of inter ;st to other Sections. Though it is left to Sections to consider the actual method by which economies afiecting their own minutes could best be mode, it will be realised that since on the one hand the .ssembiy has cut down appropriations for the printing of minutes, and on the other hand the cost of printing in Geneva has increased, the need for economisin'? remains somewhat ur gent.
