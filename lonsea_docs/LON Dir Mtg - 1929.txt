The SHCRMTARY-GAHLRML said that at a previous meeting it had been agreed that In the new buildings the library would be placed as close as possible to the Secretariat. The architects had been informed of this, but after considering the varie possibilities had unanimously decided that for architectural and other reasons (e.g. seclusion from traffic) the best site for the liorary would be on the other side of the Assembly Hall from the Secretariat. The library would then be at a distance of about 1£G metres from the Secretariat and connected with it by a covered way,
Dr. RaJCHMAIT said that in the new library there would be a special centre of documentation for reseaich on health questions and he rather feared that the r feet of the distance would be practically to separate from the Section those members who were doing research, but he would not stress this objection
2
Dame Rachel CEO'DY thought that provided the plan for sectional reading rooms in the library was carried out its position vas of minor importance.
The SECRYT^RY-GYF.ORAL having observed that the architects might find it very difficult to agree on any other plan, Is COLBilT, while testifying to his dislike of the -niana site, said that in his opinion the architects’ plan should he adopted in view of the urgent necessity for beginning the buildings.
Thiw was accordingly agreed to, it being understood that there would be:
1.	sectional reading rooms in the library;
2.	a ” sue cúrsale." for reference books, catalogues etc. m the Secretariat building;
5. some quick means of transport of books between the library and the Secretariat.

Publication of the minutes of Advisory Committees.- * 1
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that letters had been received from the President of the league of Nations Union in England \ Directors Meeting Paper Ho ,24), the World Peace foundation in the United States (Directors’ Meeting Paper No *25) and the President of the Austrian Association for the League of Nations (Directors’ Meeting Paper No.l), which dealt with two main points:
1)	the resolution of the Assembly which restricted the
publication of minutes, and
2)	the delay in publishing minutes which had been
auth oxi sed .
The Secretary-General thought that the Council’s decision authorising the publication of the minutes of a number of advisory committees really met the first point. As regards the second - delay in publication - a proposal had been made in the Secretariat that reports and minutes cf Advisory Committees should be circulated to Members of the League at the same time as to the Council, which would mean that such documents would ba
published, exception being rjiade for the Mandates Commission's minutes and reports 0 Ho did not think: that the Council would agree to such a proposal if put forward by the Secretariat on administrative grounds, as if the Council did not accept part of a report, its reasons for doing so would not be published until after the publication of the report. It might, however, be proper fox Members of the league to have cognisance of a report before it was discussed by the Council in order that they might have an opportunity of requesting attendance as specially interested States under Article 4 of the Covenant, that point, however, should be raised, not by the Secretariat but by a Member
of the league not on the Council,
The Secretary-General said that the three letters might be put into one document and sent to the Supervisory Commission which could consider them when drafting its report to the next Assembly, in which it had been asked to state whether or not a saving had resulted from the cancellation of minutes. The Supervisory Commission ought to realize that there was a strong
demand for publicity.
The Secretary-General asked for the views of those present on Mr. Buxton's proposal (Directors' Meeting Parer 110.3} that minutes of Committees should be, as far as possible, corrected by the members on the day following each meeting in order to allow revised minutes to go to print as soon as possible
Dro RAJCHMAi! did not think that members of technical Committees could be expected to correct the minutes every day. The discussions were often highly technical and the members ware really too busy at Geneva to correct Minutes. Moreover, soma delay in printing was caused by the necessary redrafting of the
Minutes by the -^rs ci s-Writer s.
3
Mr. HD3T0U said that the Secretariat arrange me nt s for getting out Council minutes were far more perfect than was the case for Committees. In order to ensure rapid printing of Committee minutes the staff ox the Precis-Writing Section and the Roneo would have to ha at least d cut led.
M. SUGI11URA and Marquis PAU LU CCI thought that it would he sufficient if the corrections could he obtained by the end of a Committee session.
The SECRETARY-0 Eli SRAI» suggested that an appeal might we 11 be made to members of committees to get their corrections made by the end of the meeting in the interests of publicity for their work.
M. CO IB AN thought that there had been considerable or -understanding among the. public as to the reasons for the a.:;-. rmv • decision. It had really been taken for financial reasons, not because the Assembly was opposed to publicity. In the rrepara-tory Commission, corrections to minutes were made day by day and persons particularly interested asking fox a revised copy of the minutes could obtain it vary shortly after the meeting which it recorded. In the Preparatory Commission all the meetings ware public and the press gave good reports of the discussions. He admitted that it was unfortunate -that on one occasion it had taken seven months to print the minutes but precautions had since been taken to avoid such a delay.
VI03HR and Mr. McKINHON WOD said that if delay
wa.-
to be avoided it was essential to have more Pr^cis-writars,
Mr. IO VEDA Y explained that the minutes of the Financial and Economic Committees were not published, because it was not desired to give publicity to the very confidential discussions which often occurred., i’he reports of these Committees were, however, circulated and published .promptly.
LT. HAAS said that the minutes ox the Transit Committee were sent tc the members after the meeting, by which trocs hure he believed they obtained a better text - and that without worrying the members of the Committee at a very busy moment.
He had, however, no objection to ITr. Buxton’s proposal provided it was possible to reinforce the Precis- ,<ri ting Section, but it was essential to have thoroughly experienced Precis-writers
V H* CATASTill! said that in the Mandates Commission, although ha toot care to ask the members every time to return the corrected minutes within £4 hours, it had often been impossible to obtain draft minutes until four days after a nesting. In any case, the minutes of the last meetings always arrived after the members had left, which involved sending the minutes of the last meetings all round Europe after them, and much correspondence in securing, corrections.
M. Catastini’s experience led him to the same conclusion as that reached by Dr. Rajchman, ITr. Huston and M. Haas, that it was essential first of all to reinforce the Central Serviœs of the League .
IT, SUG-ILURA thought that there was not- the same need fox haste in the publication of the minutes cf technical committees as there was, say, in the case of the Preparatory Commission’s minutes.
	The i	3ECR1	IIARY-G-
ag re e men	t with	the	propos
minu tes	during	t ha	me e t in.
appeal should be made to the members of Committees to get in their corrections promptly in the interests of publicity for their proceedings. An increase in IT. Schoall’s and Dr. Dixon's staff should certainly be considered.

The Secretary-General thought that the test suggestion was that an annex should he attached to the Council’s rerort to the Assembly, containing a list cf all petitions considered receivable during the year with a short account of what had happened to each. That was the only proposal which he had seen which did not seem to involve much risk: of serious opposition from Governments which had accepted minorities ob ligations* Such opposition was dangerous, for the minoritie stipulations ecu Id be amended, or even he thought abolished by a simple majority in the Council-
—'	O
IVU CuIaSTIIil said that in the case of the Mandates Commission the intricacies of procedure limited considerably the possibility ox presenting a petition. Experience had shown that this limitation was not only useful out necessary. In the case of petitions concerning minorities, the league of nations had a much more limited authority on account of the sovereignty of the States concerned. A. Catastini felt he could not agree to any change which would cause an amplification of the system of petitions concerning minorities, as such change must necessarily involve a like amplification in the system of dealing with petitions concerning mandates.
Hr. COLBAIi did not agree that minorities obligations could be abolished by a majority of the Council; in his opinion they could only be modified. (The Secretary-General agreed).
To abolish the treaties he believed that unanimity of all signatory States was required.
Ko comparison was possible between the rules of procedure for petitions from the inhabitants of mandated territories and minorities7 petitions. The procedure with regard to the latter had been established with due regard to the fact that the States concerned were sovereign States, that no "right” of petition was established under the Treaties, and that the petitions were only accepted as a means of information for the members of the Couxioil, so as to enable them to exercise their right and duty to take action in case of infraction of a clause of a minorities Treaty.
M. AGUIRRE de CARCER thought that there were three weak points in the present procedure. The Minorities Section,- and in particular M. Ascarate had made a special study of these
three points which were:
l) The small amount of time which members cf the Cc.ro:. 1 could give to these minority questions in the middle of the Council meetings. He wondered whether it would be worth asking the members of the Council to appoint experts to study ¡.linorities questions between sessions. The objection to such a procedure would be that it might well weaken the influence of the Minorities Section,
S) Some of the Council members on the Minorities Committees
vers not sufficiently experienced in minorities questions*
It might be worth considering ’whether there should be a single committee for dealing with minorities questions, consisting of experienced members of the Council, but this might result in the formation of a permanent committee - an innovation which he would certainly not propose without very careful consideration.
3)	It was most unfortunate that petitioners should be left ignorant of what happened to their petitions, particularly in the case where the Government concerned adopted a favourable attitude to the petitionerTs request.
Seno rally, he agreed wit
h
Secretary-General1s
proposal, but ’said that the Section would like to consider it
further.
did not
The SECRETARY-GEMERML said with regard to I) like the suggestion of members of the Counci
that he 1 delegating
tfc
eir responsibilities to officials who wen
by any mea:
experts In minority questions. The only real experts available in those questions were members of the Minorities Section.
With regard to S) he was afraid that if a regular committee of the Council were set up to deal with such questions, it would allow other members of the Council to shirk their responsibilities. Every member of the Council ought to feel that he was personally dealing with minority questions.
8
vi t h regard, to 3) ono of the main objects should be to avoid friction between the Governments and the petitioners.
Mi DUFOUS-FEROSCE said that there was a considerable amount of discontent among minorities. It was felt that petitions were not properly dealt with by the League because the public was left in the dark as to what happened to a petition. Something must be- done to get rid of that impression. V/hile it was important to avoid anything which would tend to make minorities disloyal to the country to which they now belonged, they should be made to feel that their rights were being upheld. He agreed with the Secretary-Geners suggestion but thought that there might be others worth considering, though he himsepf had no alternative to propose at the moment.
The SECRETifRY-GEHSRnL said that everybody agreed that there was a grievance and that an attempt must be made to meet it - perhaps by his own suggestion. If that suggestion were accepted by the Council, could the Council put it into force at once or must it await the approval of the Assembly? He thought if Roumania and Poland agreed the Council could at once act on its own responsibility.
M* CO LB AIT agreed.
Mi LUPOUS asked’Uhy the Committees of Three held their meetings in private»
The SECRMLBY-GEIiEBaL thought it would be impossible to hold thorn in public.	The work of the Committees of Three
was purely preliminary.	They had to decide whether such and
such a question should go on the Council1 s agenda. Moreover.,
9
if the meetings wore public, petitioners would be in the audience and the members of the Council would almost certainly refuse to discuss the matter in front of them,
M. CO LEAS' thought that it would be quite impossible to discuss in public whether an infraction or danger of infraction had occurred. Kg member of the Council would agree to discuss that point in public,
i,h SU&IMUM4, and M. CuTASTIJII thought that there was a far better chance of getting a settlement if the discussions a ere private.
Mo OOLBAM thought that, in order to get certain members

The draft Provisional Agenda for the March cession of the Council (Directors' Meeting paper 4* 1989) was adopted with one or two verbal amendments.
M„ IUFOUR-FEBONCE thought it advisable to avoid mentioning outside the Secretariat the suggestions regarding Minorities procedure which bad been discussed at the last Directors7 Meeting. Opinions might change, and it would be a mistake to infer that the Secretariat had adopted any definite line.
The SECRETARY-GENE RAM agreed that no one ought to quote discussions at Directors1 Meetings as such, but of course this must not be held to impose any limitation on his own responsibilities as Secretary-General .=
M. IKJFOUR-FEB ONCE said that he undersooed that Dr. Strasemann would probably write a letter to the Secretary-General saying that he would himself like to submit some proposals to the Council on Minorities.
g -
■The SECRETARY~GEUBEAR said that he had expressly not inserted on the March Agenda the question whether Advisory Opinions could ha ashed from the Court by a majority vote, Mr. Root was coming over to Europe and he might hare some instructions from the Government of the United States concerning the Court. If that were so a premature discussion ty the Caine il could only prejudice the position.

The SECRET ARY -GENERAL said that the Turkish Consul had telephoned to the Secretariat to enquire as t o the indeb tedne ss of the Turkish Government for the expenses of the Commission of Enquiry on the Mosul frontier. Uithcut wishing to attach any undue importance to the matter, he thought this showed not only that the Turkish Government might he going to repay its share of these expenses tut also that it was taking considerable interest in the league.

Dame Rachel CRO'/ffiY said that the Central Board looked like being a business-like Committee and clearly wished to work in very close touch with the Advisory Committee and the Secretariat. She had been appointed Acting Secretary, pending the appointment of a regular Secretary.

1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL, referring to the decision cf
the Assemb ly that the Codification Conference should he held in 1929 if the Disarmament Conference was not held in that year, said that, while it seemed unlikely that the Disarnsment Conference could he held before 1930, it now appeared that it might also ha imuossihle to hold the Codification Conference before the Spring of 1930. However, the Preparatory Committee for the Codification Conference would he in a positi to consider this question further at its next meeting in Anri 1

The S3CRBTARI-GFEERajL asked directors to expedite as far as possible the preparation of Rapporteurs' Reports for the next session of the Council,
Mr. JACK LIB said that, as M. Avenol, the Chairs an of the Publications Committee, was absent, he would like to inform the meeting ox the reasons why Sections had been asked to have documents other than those of an urgent character ■printed in Branca. This was due not only to motives of economy but to the desire to avoid establishing a monopoly in favour of Geneva printers.	The Secretariat had been
forced to place work in Branca when in 1926 the Geneva printers raised their prices by 10y. If these reasons were understood, Directors would feel less impatient about the greater delays involved in printing in France.
M. CAT AS TIBI saie that this Question interested him or/ much, but he thought it would be barter to discuss it before the Publications Committee, when it could be thoroughly examined .
The SBCRBTARY-GEBERaL agreed, adding that he aimed at inducing the French printers to shorten the delay so that printing in France would not take much longer time than printing in Geneva.
The Marquis PaULUCCI DI CaLBOLI observed that time was lost not only at the printers but at the Secretariat also.

1.	The SECRETARY-GB1T3RAL said that he had reason to believe that the Hungarian Opt ants Question might be shortly settled, possibly before the March meeting of the Council.
2,	The Secretary-General thought that the question of Minorities procedure would be the most important to be dealt with at the March meeting of the Council. So far neither Dr. Stresemann nor M. liandurara has sent in any proposals.
3 c	The Sec ret ary-General hoped that soon after the
Council session the architects would be in a position to submit a final plan.	If they did so he expected that a mseting of
the Committee of Five should be summoned at once, and that if the Committee approved the ml an certain further work might be begun at once pending the final approval ox the Council.

The Meeting considered the order of items in the Agenda cf the 54th session of the Council (Directors' Meeting Paper 6, 1929) .
Various suggestions were made which Mr. Buxton was ashed to note for the revised edition of the Agenda.
The Agenda for Monday morning was determined.
2
Tha SEdBETARY-GSITERal said that a tela gram had coma from the Lithuanian Government claiming representation on the Council, in accordance with Article 4 of tha Covenant for the discussion of the procedure relative to the protection of minorities and nominating a representative. The Secretary-General thought that this claim might he considered immediately after the adoption of the Agenda and that for reasons of courtesy the Lithuanian representative might he ashed to explain to the Council the grounds on which his Government "based their claim o
In reply to M. Comert, Mr. CO LB All said that when Hungary put forward a claim for representation on tha Council for the discussion cp the rules of investigation, the Council appointed a Committee of Jurists to consider the claim. Tha Jurists had reported that a State not represented on the Council could not claiip a special interest in the Council's general discussion of such a Question.
The SECRETARY-GS1TERAL thought that this precedent might be followed in the present cassE A Committee of Jurists could be appointed on Monday and report the following day.
M. HJFGUR agreed.
M. SUGIMUBA thought that the Committee should deal not with any general question of the application of Article 4 of the Covenant but only with tha particular request of Lithuania.
3
Mo EUSEO agreed, as it was desirable to avoid putting the question to the Jurists in a form which might lead to similar claims on the part of other States bound by minorities treaties,
M. SUGIBURA said that the distinction should not be forgotten between the method of dealing with subjects on the Councils Agenda which the Council itself was alone competent to decide, and the actual consideration ox those questions for which it was sometimes necessary to invite n on-members «
Mo AGUIRRE thought that the solution might be found in granting to Lithuania a " voix consultative" instead of a "voix deliberative".
The SECRETARY -GENERAL said that these points could be left to the Jurists.
3.	The SECiiE lARY-GEUEEAI said that Dr. Rajchman had
been invited by the Chinese Government to act as one of its pub lie-health advisers. Ha had authorised Dr* Ranchman to accept the invitation in principle. The matter would be submitted to the Council,, which he hoped would approve the acceptance of so gratifying an offer.

MINUTAS
OF THE DIRECTONS'
CTING HELD OH MEDIAE SPAY,

The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the next session of the Council, which was to be held at Madrid, would probably be postponed, on account of the British election to June 10th. This would also be satisfactory to the International Labour Office. The Committee of the Council for Minorities Questions would probably meet, also at Madrid, on the 5th or 6th.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL reminded the Directors that next week the examination of the budget should begin in earne s t.
At the request of the SECRETARY-GENERAL,
Sir Arthur SALTER gave certain impressions of his recent visit to the United States. The time of his visit had not been good for official contacts, as Mr. Hoover did not come up to Washington until the moment of his inauguration, and most of his intended Ministers kept away t<*o.
Still

he had seen a number of peoole who were close to the Administration, and had gathered that fundamentally the American policy towards the League would not be changed, at any rate not to the extent of incurring any political rislfe. On the other hand, there might be a certain increase in pace. It was thought likely that Mr. Hoover would push forward the oositive organisation of American exnort trade (development of system and commercial attaches, e.tc.), especiallyr in South America.
Iron the League point of view the tariff' situation was bad, and a furious wave of nrotection was passing over the country. It should be remembered that in the United States the Congress was both the proposer and the maker of tariffs. It might he hoped that the Administration would act to a certain extent as a brake.	The Democratic Party
had more or less abandoned its anti-protectionist position. Some day, he felt sure, a reaction ’would set it, hut that would not be soon. It could only happen when the large exporting industries realised that there was nothing to be got out of protection, and also when the farmers saw that that was not the way In which agricultural relief was to he sought.
In reply to the SLCRETARY— GENERAL, Sir Arthur SALTER said that he heard nothing of subsidies or bounties for particular export trades.
In reply to M. DUFOUR-FERONCE, Sir Arthur SALTER said that the effect of an increase of tariffs would be to raise prices internally, but not immediately, as in a country with so large an Internal market as the U.S.A., the results of tariff changes took some time to make themselves felt by the consumer.
encountered
As regards the Kellrgg-Pact, he had in legal and other circles a minimising vie?», which if widely adopted might he dangerous. This was to the effect that because in the Pact negotiations the right of self-defence had been safeguarded, if a State claimed that its actions in a given case however unreasonable and even aggressive they might appear, were measures of self-defence, no third party could dispute its interpretation of the term. He felt that much depended on whether the Kell«gg-Pact were to be interpreted in the States in a wide or narrow sense.
The SECRETARY-&ENERAL thou ght that American feelings in the matter could not be judged until a case which tested them arose. The excitement displayed in America over a statement depreciatory of the Kellogg Past, imputed to the British Eoreign Secretary and denied by him, seemed to show that the -American people took the Pact to heart more than was supposed.
Sir Arthur 5AX.TER agreed, with the reservation that there was a danger of the Pact being drained of its effect before it came t® be applied.
IV.
Mr. COLBAIi said that the Committee of Experts of the Spe cial Committee on Private Manufacture had just met.
At the meeting of the Spe cial Committee in December the Belgian delegation had proposed the redraft of the first Article of the draft Convention. This contained a list of war material, and was similar to the list given in the Traffi* in*Arms Convention. If the whole question of classification were to be reopened the position would have been
serious, so that he was gratified, if surprised, when The Experts turned down the Belgian proposal. ine to.sk of tne Special CommissEon was still difficult, and he tnought that
4
it might ho wise for a discussion to take place at the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference. The oaecial Committee mould have to meet again before the Assembly.
In reply to Sir Arthur SALTER, Mr. COLEAN said that the meeting of the Preparatory Committee in April would not be the last, but with a little goodwill he felt that considerable progress, at any rate in the technical fields, could be made. It was wrong to suppose that nothing could be done until the naval question was settled. The Committee would have to consider important proposals from the U.3.3.R., and from Germany (publicity).
The Committee would also have to decide when it would be in a position to deal with the three burning questions of naval disarmament, ’’materiel stocké” and traiixd reserves.
P.	M. HAAS referred to the recent meetings of the
Committee on the Regime of Ports and Maritime Navigation..
On the subject of tonnage ne asurement and maritime navigation a complete agreement had been reached. As regards buoying and lighting of coasts, it had been decided' to propose a conference of all maritime countries to meet in the second half of 1930. This would be an interesting event, especially in view of the universal and not merely European character of the subjects
In reply to the SECRETARY-GENERAL, M. HAAS said that progress before the Advisory Committee on the Polish-Lithuanian question was likely to be fairly deliberate. He felt certain that no substantial proposals would come before the Council in
T une.
s
M. BAAS also gave certain information in connection with the questions of the calendar and a fixed Easter. In respect of Easter, he felt that in view of the possibility of the resumption in the not too distant future of the meeting of the Oecumenical Council, it might be worth while to see if existing differences of opinion between the civil authorities might not be to some extent settled beforehand through a Conference or otherwise.
YI.	M. AZCABATE said that the negotiations between
Poland and Germany with regard to certain points arising out of the Convention, which had been proposed by the Council, would take place at Paris on the 25th March.

the Statute.
Tlie iviarquis PidULUCCI DX CALBOLI said, that too many meetings of Committees and nub-Committees were still beinn held ou uside Geneva. Referring to the Assemblyrs resolution on this subject he asked Secretaries of Committees to exercise stronger pressure than they had done formerly against such meetings being held.
The SEC RAT ARY-GENERAL agreed in principle, adding that the test should be a budgetary one; in exceptional cases a meeting outside Geneva was not more expensive than a meeting in Genev cl •
Mr. CCLBA1T thought it would be useful if the Under-Secretary-General in Charge of Internal Administration would keep a record of the staff taken by Directors to assist them at meetings put side Geneva, and if it should at any time appear that mne Section was too lavish in its staff arrangements he might draw attention to it. He did not, on the other hand, propose that the number of staff should depend on previous agreement between the Under-Secretary-General and the Director but only that the same standard should be apnlied throughout the Secretari so far as oossible.
M. SUGIMURA emphasised that Directors must themselves
take responsibility within the limits of the
budget for the staff
that they take with Sections should be that the discretion
them and understood that any pressure on exercised only if there seemed some indication enjoyed Directors was being abused.

-GENERAL, summing up, said that if a outside Geneva the Director concerned Secretary-General (l) that the meeting the staff he intended to take for the
~ri—
meeting. This practice would enable the Under-Secretary-General to make representations if, over a period of time, he thought there were signs of extravagance on the part of a Section. This did not apply to official journeys, but only to Conference or Committee meetings.

1»	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he had received from
the Marquis Paulucci di Galboli Barone the report on the revision of the Staff Regulations. The report was on the whole conservative, but proposed a number of changes, the most important cf which were the substitution of an age limit of sixty for the limited contracts at present in force and the establishment of a Pension Scheme. After discussing certain points with the Committee, a Secretary-General report would be drafted which would be communicated to the Under Secretarles-General and Directors who had not formed part of the Committee, and to the International Labour Office and the Court. He hoped to submit it to the Meeting of the Supervisory Commission to be held on May 22nd.
The Secretary-General took this opportunity of thanking the Committee for its report which had entailed a very great amount of labour and which would be a valuable basis for the final report which it would be his duty to submit to the Supervisory Commission.
-2-
2o	The Marquis PAULUCCT DI CxfLBQliT BARONS said that
the Secretariat had received a draft plan from the architects which was to be examined forthwith by the Committee of Five,
The Committee would doubtless have occasion to consult the Secretariat and possibly the Building Committee and the architects themselves, with regard to certain aspects of the plan.
In reply to Mr, Jacklin, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said he thought it would be for the Building Committee to
draw up exact estimates before tenders were asked for, but the Secretariat should at any rate have rough estimates ready for September.
3,	M. ASCARATE referring to the negotiations which had
recently taken place under the presidency of M. Adatci and with the assistance of M. Calonder between representatives of Germany and Poland with regard to certain questions arising out of the Convention on Upper Silesia, said that the Delegates had agreed, subject to approval by their Governments, to certain changes in the procedure in dealing with petitions, the most important result cf which should be that the Council would be relieved from dealing with unimportant petitions. It had not been possible to agree on the question of the enrolment cf children in Minorities Schools, but negotiations on this subject would
probably be resumed.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said the M. Azcarate had modestly concealed from the Meeting the fact that these negotiations had on the whole been extraordinarily successful, far more sc than It was reasonable to expect. One result should be better collaboration between the two parties in the procedure before the
local authorities.
-I "the request of the Secretary-General, Sir Arthur
SALTER sumr
aarised the present state
ci tno economic worn
c.f the League„
With regard to the coal problem, Sir Arthur Salter said that the Economic Committee, haring in the last few months * obtained the advice of experts representing the point of view of the owners and the workers, had drawn up a picture of the coal situation regarded from the world point of view. This was an interim report only and did not contain proposals for action - these would follow later - but it was a novel and interesting piece of work. It would be published forthwith.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that in view of the rule that reports of Committees to the Council were confidential until the Council had dealt with them, the authority of the Council should be obtained for the publication of the coal report. This could be done by securing the consent of the President and Rapporteur, and giving the other members of the Council a short time within which to raise objections if they did not agree
The Committee had also consulted experts on the sugar question but this work was not so far advanced« Independent reports by certain experts would probably be shortly published by the Committee«
The Committee had, moreover, now definitely begun to study the question of the relation between economic policy and peace« It was too early for official negotiations and discussions, but unofficial study was now well under way.
The Committee was also following up the various othe: subjects under its consi

felt that this annual meeting of the Consultative Committee
was	destined to	become	more and nor	e the pivot	of the inter-	
nat	ional ccnside	ration	of economic	problems and	also	that
the	report whiah	would	be submitted	to it would	tend	more
and	more to be a	world	economic sur	vey,		
A.s regards the removal of harriers to trade which the Economic Conference cf 1927 had advocated,
the action tahen coulc
considered under three heads:
a)	Unilateral action, that is, action by different Governments in the direction cf a recommendation to the Conference;
b)	Bilateral action, that is, negotiations between individual Governments for tariff reductions;
c)	Multilateral action, or concerted action of all Governments through the League.
In 1927 a distinct advance had been made in respect of points a) and b). In 1928 there had been a reaction in these respects but as regards c) the conclusion of the Convention on the abolition of export and import prohibitions was a remarkable advance.
It was of course to be recognised that the work done so far was merely outpost skirmishing; no a had yet been made upon the central citadel 'of hi 5.	I

subjects were being treated in the Secretariat and to give them an opportunity of calling for the relevant files. He wondered whether the synopsis as at present compiled served any useful purpose.
The SHCFMTARY-CHNIMAL, having ascertained t hat certain sections - notably the Information Section -would regret the discontinuance of the daily synopsis, even in its present form, thought a study should be made of the question whether the s¿mopsis could be rendered more informative. He asked the Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone, Monsieur Dufour-F^ronce and another member tc be appointed by the Information Section to undertake this study with the assistance of the Registrar under whose instructions the synopsis
was drawn up.
6_	Mr. JACKLIi'T said that the Supervisory
Commission would consider the Budget on April 24th.
The SBCRETARY-GEISSRAL felt that it should recognise that the Draft Budget for this year was, from the point of view of economy, the most perfect that had yet been presented.

1.	The meeting considered the Draft Agenda of the
Tenth Ordinary Session of the Assembly (D. 11.paper 7). Various suggestions ere made, hich Mr. Burton -'as ashed to insert in the final test of the Agenda.
It ’..as agreed that Items 1-5 should be incorporated in a single Item entitled "Items of Procedure”,
’■ itfa sub-headings.
With reference to the revision of the Staff Regulations, etc., on which subject it was agreed an item should be inserted, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that his report mould have to go before the Supervisory Commission. He mould consider later whether the item should appear as a Secretary-Generalrs report or as a Supervisory Commission report.
As regards Disarmament, A. CO LB AN said that he did not yet know if the Council mould require a special
- s
item to be placed on the Supplementary Agenda of the Assembly.,
If not, the procedure adopted last year would be followed.
2.	The Marquis PAULUCCI TI CALBOLI said that the Committee
of Five at its recent meeting had considered the draft plan f'cr the new building prepared by the architects and had held it to be in general satisfactory.	Before taking a final decision it
proposed to obtain further information from a Secretariat Committee, from the Building Committee with regard to costs, and fr om the Librarian.	Their observations would be presented
to the architects and it was hoped that the Committee of Five, having received the final report of tire architects, would be able to submit a definite proposal to the Council at its June session.
The Committee had also asked the architects to complete the plan ior the Assembly Hall so that it might be examined from the acoustic point of view by the British Scientific Research Society.	It was of course most necessary that the acoustic
properties of the Hall should be satisfactory, but there were also other considerations, e.g. suitable accommodation for delegates, etc., to be taken into account.
3.	The SECRETARY-GEIGRAL said that the Secretariat had
received a number of observations from Governments on Minorities procedure, and also from private organisations. The observations of Governments, and some of those from private organisations,
were being submitted in full to the Committee of Three, whins the observations of other organisations, which were largely in the form of specific complaints rather than oi proposals lor changes
of procedure, would be mentioned on a List to be the Committee so that any member could see them
communicated to vished.

Directors’ Meeting 252
MINUTES OF THE DIRECTORS' MEETING.
Held on Tuesday, May 28th, 1929 at 3.30 p.m.
Present:	The Secretary-General
The Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone Monsieur Dufour Feronce Monsieur Sugimura Dame Rachel Crowdy MM. Aguire Bonnet Boudreau Buero Catast ini Comert Huston Jacklin Mathenet Romein Salter Saunders Schoell.
1.	The meeting considered the order of items for the 55th Session of the Council (Directors’ Meeting,. Paper 9).
Certain suggestions were made which Mr. Buxton was asked to note for the revised edition of the agenda.
2.	The Meeting considered the method of preparation of the genera report to the Assembly (Directors' Meeting, Paper 10, 1929).
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that complaints were often made that the report was at presaat too detailed for general reading. It was originally intended to give a view of the work of the League as a whole for the use both of delegates to the Assembly and of the Press and various private organisations interested in the League, It was formerly written by one Editor and the different parts were sent to the respective Sections to be checked. This ensured a certain unity of style. Now the practice had grown up whereby Sections themselves wrote their own parts of the reports. There was in consequence no unity of style and there was a marked lack of proportion. On the whole
he thought it better to return to the old system. It was perhaps a little more trouble but there was no doubt that the report would gain greatly from being written by one competent man.
The Marquis PAULUCCI DI CALBOLI BARONE generally agreed, but suggested that the work might be done by a drafting committee, of say three people, working on material supplied by the Sections.
The SECRETlRY-GENERAL preferred a single editor to a drafting committee which he thought was more suitable for drafting resolutions than for more or less original work, but saw no objection to the Sections supplying the material.
Mr. SAUNDERS agreed that it was useful for the editors to have a skeleton draft from Sections, the report being then written by the editors, the various parts submitted t'o the Sections and the whole referred to the Secretary-General for his final approval.
Sir Arthur SALTER agreed that there was need to improve the style of the report but said that the report was not only needed for the Assembly as a whole, but the various parts of it as the basis of work for the Assembly Committees. Could not the Editor write a quite short summary something like the review of the work of the League which the President of the Council gave at the opening of the Assembly, xo be followed by chapters dealing with the work of the Sections in detail?
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that it must not be assumed that the various chapters of the report could entirely replace the Committee minutes and other documents as the basis of work of
the Committees.
-3-
Mr. MATHENET said that the Disarmament Section had submitted an exceptionally full account of its work for the report hut this had been for special reasons. The Preparatory Committee had just held an important session hut had made no report. It had, in fact, teen understood that the disarmament chapter of the general report to the Assembly would give an authoritative account of the work on disarmament.
M. SUGIMURA felt that the danger of summaries which were too complete should he guarded against. Short summaries were usually safe, but long summaries often dangerous.
M. MATHENET asked whether a member of each Section could not he appointed to collaborate with the editors in preparing the report.
Mr. SAUNDERS, referring to an observation made by Sir Arthur Salter to the effect that it would always be difficult to resist the demands of Sections for the inclusion of their dullest material, said that an even greater trouble was that the editor was always in danger of falling betweei two stools if the work had to be both safe and readable.
M. COMERT said that the Monthly Summary was nearly always written by the editor and the parts corrected by the Sections. H© thought this method gave satisfactorjr results.
M. SCBOELL said that it might be useful to decide beforehand approximately how many pages should be allotted to the work of each Section.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL, resuming the discussion, said that it was perhaps too late for any change to be made in the main report for the present year, but the supplementary report should be written on the lines on which all seemed to agree. This would mean that the editor would write an introductory summary of about four pages, would inform Sections of approximately how many pages were
-4-
at their disposal for the subsequent chapters, would himself write these chapters with the assistance, if desired, of a a skeleton draft from Sections, would let Sections make any necessary corrections in the chapters which concerned them and would submit the complete text to the Secretary-General for his approval. It was understood that each Section could appoint someone to collaborate with the editor if thought desirable.
3.	The Marquis PAULUCCI DI CALBOLI BARONE said that the architects had sent in their final report which would be submitted to the Committee of Five and afterwards to the Council. It was hoped that the foundation stone jould be laid while
the Assembly was in session.
4.	In reply to M. Dufour FERONCE, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought there was no likelihood of a discussion by the Council on the recent communications from Bolivia and Paraguay.

of the 56th session of the Council (D.M. 11.1929).
Certain suggestions regarding the order of the items were made, which the Secretary of the Drafting Committee was asked to note for the next edition of the Agenda.
2.	The Acting SECRETARY-GENERAL asked Sections which
provided for the secretariat of League Commissions to consider the question of invitations to the Presidents or other representatives of such Commissions to attend the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone of the League buildings. In examining this point he asked Sections to bear in mind the possibility that some of the Presidents would doubtless be attending the session of the Assembly in any case. It was doubtful whether it would be feasible to pay the travelling expenses and subsistence allowance to enable representatives of Commissions to come to Geneva specially for the ceremony.

The SECRETARY-GENERAL requested that as many subjects as possible might be available for discussion on the first tv;o days of the Council meeting. The Council might have very little opportunity of meeting during the first week of the Assembly and at the beginning of the second week the new Council would be elected.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked that in reply to questions which would doubtless be put regarding the Secretariat's view on the choice of President of the Assembly members of the Secretariat should state that this was a matter for the Assembly itself to decide, The Secretariat had been criticised in the past for informally suggesting names for this office.
As regards the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of Committees the situation was a little different as delegates seemed to expect that the Secretariat should be in a position to suggest names. In doing this attention should be paid to
the need for
2
1.	efficiency,
2.	the desirability of giving each country, as
far as possible, its turn.
The Chairman of Committees should possess,
1.	a good knowledge of one of the League languages and at least a nodding acquaintance with the other.
2.	experience of the working of the Assembly;
3.	knowledge of Parliamentary procedure.
It sometimes happened that first delegates who might otherwise be appointed to the Chairmanship of the Committees did not possess ail these qualifications. Por this reason he thought the time had come when it might be wise to increase by 2 the number of Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. This was a point which might be considered at the meeting, which dealt with Assembly matters»
The SSGRLTARY-GSICRAL thought that if a settlement of principle was arrived at at the Hague the Assembly Session should be important and successful. If not, he feared that the intere of the Session would lie chiefly in private conversations between the leading delegates.
The MASQUIS PAULUCCI di CALBOLI reminded Directors that the Conference for the Codification of International Law would meet at the Hague on the 13th of March, and probably last until late in April. Heavy demands on the central services, and especially on its more experienced members, would be made by this Conference, and he would be grateful if every effort could be made to avoid the meeting of League committees during the
session
3
Dame Radie 1 Crewdy having stated that two Connaît toe s served by her Section had already arranged, with the approval of the Council* to meet in April, the SECRSfARY-GENSRAL agreed that the tine of these meetings could hardly be changed but he asked that any section not so committed should comply with the Marquis Paulucci di Calboli's recommendation,
Mr. HUSTCN said that a difficulty regarding the Hague Conference was that only highly trained interpreters and other members of the central services would be of any use,
M, COLBidT wondered whether for the highly specialised work of the Conference temporary officials, e.g., young jurists as minute writers, could not be found who would he just as competent for the work as the League staff,
The ¡SECRETARY-GENERAL asked Mr. Huston to consider this point and further asked the Treasurer to examine carefully the financial aspects of the employment of additional staff which might he required for the Conference.
4.	In reply to Dame Rachel Crowdy the SECRETARY-GENERAL
said that the Petition on Prison Reform from the Howard League had never been on the Agenda of the Council. Reference to it had been inserted in the list of communications from non-off icial international organisations and M. Pro cope had asked that the Petition should be communicated to the Council.
The Secretary-General had no knowledge that it was the intention of any member of the Council to place the matter on its Agenda,

WEDNESDAY. AUGUST 21st, 1929,
Present:
The SECRETARY-GENERAL Mo DUE OUR-FEE ONCE M. SUGIMURA DAME RACHEL CROWDY MMo ABRAHAM AZCARATE BONNET CATASTINI CO LEAN COMERT HAAS HUSTON JAC7CLIN PIETROMARCHI ROSTING RAJCHMAN STOPPANI TEIZIDOR.
The Meeting considered the order of the items on the agenda of the 56th Session of the Council (D.M. Paper 13).
Certain observations were made which Mr. Buxton was asked to note for the revised agenda.
Mr. COLBAN referring to the offer of £100 which had been made under certain conditions by Mr. Blanco, said that in his opinion this offer was intended as a means of exercising pressure on the Council. Was the Secretary-General bound to submit such offers to the Council? If he was so bound it might be wise for the Council to authorise him to refuse such submission in future at his discretion.
Mr. JACKLIN thought that as under the present rules only the Council could accept gifts it followed that only the Council could refuse them. They had therefore to be submitted to the Council. An amendment of the financial regulations would be necessary to give effect to Mr. Colban's views.
After some discussion it was agreed that Mr. Blanco’s offer would have to bo submitted to the Council, and that the terms of the Rapporteur's report would depend on whether Mr. Blanco's letter was circulated with his offer.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that on the whole it would be best that the letter should be circulated.
Dame RACHEL CROYDY thought that if the letter was circulated it would be necessary for the report to explain that the Publications Committee had decided that the printing of the Opium Minutes, the delay in which had led to Mr. Blanco's offer, should be done by the slower method. Incidently, should not the Publications Committee before taking such a decision consult the Section concerned.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that this should be
done.
Mr. JACK LIN thought that it should be made clear in the report on Mr. Blanco’s offer that the opium budget was in fact sufficient for printing the minutes by the quicker method, On the other hand, he wondered whether the time taken to print them - 6 months - was really excessive.	It was not excessive
compared to the time taken to print the minutes of the Assembly.
Dr. RAJCHMAN thought that a committee was in a very different position from the Assembly in this matter. If a committee knew that its minutes would be printed, its report to the Council was very summary. If then the minutes were not printed for long afterwards they lost a great deal of their interest.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL doubted whether it was possible to print all minutes by the quicker and more expensive method. The Assembly had often made attacks which it would probably renew, on the high cost of League printing.
In reply to Dr. RÂJCHMA1T the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the request received from Bolivia for assistance in its public health organisation should be placed on the agenda of the Council, and that it might be necessary to ask the Assembly for a supplementary credit,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought it would be necessary that the Hungarian Oprants question should be discussed by the Council before the Assembly meeting.
The Meeting considered the arrangements for the 10th Session of the Assembly (Directors' Meeting Paper 12, 1929).
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he supported the proposal to increase the number of Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by two. The proposal could be justified on the ground that the number of the members of the League had been considerably increased since the number of Vice-Presidents had been fixed at six. Moreover, the increase gave the Assembly a freer hand to appoint satisfactory presidents of Assembly committees.
In reply to M. OCMERT the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought the debate on the work of the League should be continuous.	Every effort should be made to see that some
Delegate was willing to open the debate.
Item 14.
M. HAAS thought that Item 14 should have added to it: "except the question of communications
with the League in time Item 14 should be dealt
oi crisis” and that this aspect with by the Third Committee.
of
Item 6 and Item 7.
M' SUGULTRA, wondered whether he was right to refer these questions to the Third Committee. Item 7 had nothing to do with disarmament. Item 6 had a historical connection with disarmament hut it would now be more aprropriate to deal with it in the Sixth Committee.
At M. Sugimurafs request Mr. ABRAHAM explained the
reasons in favour of referring financial assistance to the sixth Committee. It was true that this question had formerly been treated in connection with disarmament and that it was on condition that it should be accompanied by a certain measure of disarmament that the British Government had accepted the
principle of the scheme; but had not the time come when it might be wise to weaken the connection between financial assistance and disarmament and to recognise that financial
assistance, though first designed as a means of enforcing Article 16 of the Covenant, had an independent value as a preventive measure in the hands of the Council for the better application of Article 11.
M. HAAS thought that there was some advantage in keeping the question before the Third Committee whose Delegates had always treated it and were, therefore, familiar with it.
The Third Committee could of course refer certain aspects of the question to the other Assembly committees.
Mr. CO LB AH thought that the matter should be treated from a purely practical point of view. A/ould it be con-
venient for the Assembly to discuss the
question in the
Sixth Committee especially as
this year the most important
Delegates would probably sit should not be forgotten that
on the Third Committee? it many Delegates insisted that
it was impossible to
separate disarmament
from security,
- 5
and it might he unwise for the Secretariat to take any initiative which at first sight look like separation.
TJie SECRETARY-GMERA1 thought that Mr. AbrahamTs argument had much weight and that if financial assistance were a new question, it should not go to the Third Committee. On the other hand, in the way it had been treated hy the Assembly it had a very real connection with disarmament, and, on the whole, he would prefer that it should remain with the Third Committee.
Item 17.
lame Rachel CROWDY asked that the two items included in this heading should, if possible, be treated as separate.
Item 10.
Dame Raohol CROWDY reminded the Meeting that the Refugee questions for whioh the 1.1.0. had been responsible had always been dealt with by the Fifth Committee whose Delegates consequently knew them well. She wondered whether it was wise to transfer the item to the Sixth Committee.
M. SUGrlMURA thought that with the cessation of the part played by the 1.1.0. in this matter its aspect had changed and become more political.
The SECRETARY-GEUERA1 agreed that the political and constitutional elements of the question were now the most important, and he thought that it should be dealt with by the Sixth Committee.
The Secretary-General hoped that the elections of ¿judges to the Court would be held as late in the Session as possible. The same applied to the elections of the
6
new Supervisory Commission, as it was desirable that the existing Commission should deal with the supplementary credits.
The SECKEIAFT-GENERAL, referring to a proposal made by Major Buxton earlier in the year to the effect that in order to improve the drafting of Assembly resolutions and reports these should pass through the Drafting Committee before being finally adopted, said that he did not propose to make any rule on this subject but would like effect to be given to Major Buxton's suggestion vihenever practicable.
The difficulty of following such a course was emphasised by various members of the Meeting.
The Secretary-General while admitting that he was giving a oounsel of perfection repeated his request that whenever practicable Major Buxton's suggestion should be aoted upon.
M. de MOSTEDACH pointed out that according to the rules of procedure of the Assembly the General Committee was entitled to make changes of form though not of substance in Assembly resolutions, subjeot of course to final approval by the Assembly.
There was general agreement that it would be most unwise to apply this rule.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that order and quiet on the Assembly platform had last year been a little better than previously but still left much room for improvement.
Dr. RAJCKMM thought that it was necessary to make drastic changes and to reduce the number of seats on the platform so as to accommodate only those officials who had to be there, e.g., the representatives of the Information Section, the Legal Seotion, the Precis Writers and the
7
Secretary-GeneralTs office. The presence of so many members of the Secretariat on the platform, the movements they made and the conversations they indulged in were most disturbing to people in the body of the hall.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL added that in any case there should be no movement on the platform during speeches.
M. CATA8TINT said that it was sometimes imperative for Directors whose presence on the platform was required to enter or leave it during a speech.
M. de MONTESACH thought that admission to the Secretariat room behind the platform was too liberal.
»
Mr, COLBAN suggested that there ought to be more space in the roar of the hall where officials oould discuss matters
with Delegates.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked Directors to think the matter over and if they had any praotical idea to submit it to him in y/riting or to bring it up at the next Directors7 Meeting.
Mr. HUSTON said that though Directors had been asked to inform him of the names of Presidents of Commissions to be invited to the foundation stone ceremony, only two had done so.
After discussion it was agreed that printed cards of invitation should be sent to the Presidents of Commissions by name, and to them only. If any President then wrote to ask that a Yice-Prosident or other member of the Committee should replace him it should be possible to arrange it, but no such suggestion should emanate from the Secretariat. It was also agreed that this form of invitation would make it clear that travelling expenses would not be paid by the league.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
Directors' Meeting 256. MINUTES OF TEL DIRECTORS' MELTING KELP ON WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 28th, AT 5.50.

The Deputy Secretary-General,
The Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone,
M. Dufour-Feronce,

Dame Rachel Growdy,

1.	The meeting considered the question of the date of
the issue of the Annual Report on the Work of the League (Directors' Meeting Paper 14.1929).
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that from the papers circulated it appeared that only two alternatives were possible:
1)	that there should be an increase in the number of proof correctors;
2)	that the Report in order to be issued on the 1st July should cover the ground only up to May 1st, instead of May 15th.
M. COLBAN insisted that it would be a great advantage not only to comparatively distant States, but to European States, especially those not represented on the Council, if the Report could be issued on July 1st, instead of July 12th, as it wculd
enable the various questions to be studied before the summer holidays. It should also be remembered that many overseas countries were represented by delegates in Europe, to whom the same considerations sp plied.
He realised that it might be difficult to ask for an increase in the Budget this year so as to provide for extra proof readers. On the other hand, would it not still be possible both to cover the ground up to May loth and to issue the Report on July 1st if Sections were to make a special effort to put their proposals before Mr. Palmer immediately after May 15th, and collaborate energetically with him until the Report was finished?
Sir Arthur SALTER said that it was important to his Section that the Report should cover the period from May 1st to May 15th, as it was then that the Economic Consultative Committee met.
The SECRETARY-GEHERAL thought that perhaps additional temporary proof readers might be engaged for the work of the Report only, and if so the expenses could be charged to the Assembl3r chapter of the Budget.
M. SUC-IMURA thought that by better organisation the wor could be done with little, if any, extra expense. Some chapter of the Report, for instance, could be written earlier than May 15th.	He thought also that the Resort on the work of the
League should have precedence over other woik, and that it was for other work that the temporary proof readers should be used.
The Marquis PAHLUCCI said that it was hard to make a rule, as the conditions of work varied greatly, but in any case additional proof readers would be needed in most years.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL, summing up, said that:
1} he v/ould ask Sections to make the additional effort suggested by F. Colban, so that the Report could cover the period to May 15th, and yet be issued on July 1st;
2)	additional temporary proof readers would be engaged, if necessary (for the purposes of the Report);
3)	if there w.as a conflict between the Sections and the editors of the Report as to the preference to be given in printing various documents, the matter should be referred to the Publications Committee.
The meeting resumed its discussion, adjourned from the previous week, on the means of assuming order on the platform of the Assembly hall.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that the only solution was that no one should be allowed on the platform, except those who definitely had to be there for the purposes of their work. In any case speeches could not be heard on the platform, so it was better to listen to them from the back of the hall,
The Marquis PAULUCCI thought that in theory Sir Arthur Salter was right, but that practically it was impossible to enforce so strict a rule. Until there was a suitable Assembly hall the best that could be done was to urge members of the Secretariat to conform to the instructions off the relevant Office Circular.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the chief things needful were that those on the platform should, whilst speeches were in progress, refrain from:
1)	talking;
2)	moving about;
3)	standing about.

III.
IV.
M. COLBAN wondered why sufficient room for members of the Secretariat could not be reserved at the rear of the hall,
Mr. HUSTON said that when there was a crowded meeting it was practically impossible to prevent assistant delegates and their wives from taking empty seats.
M. COMERT thought that on each seat on the platform a printed notice should be placed asking for silence.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL feared that there was no radical solution in the present circumstances, except to impress on members of the Secretariat the need to conform to the instructions
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought it would he wise if the General Committee met at 3 instead of at mid-day on Tuesday, the Assembly meeting at 5.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he was still considering possible names for presidents of committees. He would ask Directors in offering any suggestions to him to avoid proposing delegates whom, because their country had been represented on the Committee recently or for other reasons, the Assembly would refuse to elect.
Dr. RAJCEMAN said that Bolivia would he represented by its Minister in Paris during the Council discussion of its request for assistance in its public health organisation.
5
The SECRETARY-GENERAL aaid that some of the leading members of the Council might not come for its first two days, and in these circumstances it might be wise to adjourn consideration of the following questions:
1)	reduction in number of sessions of the Council;
2)	the laumann-Grabe petition;
3)	the Optants.
AGUIRRE described the progress of the recent negotiations in Paris with regard to the Naumann-Gra.be petition. The results had not been unsatisfactory. Of the cases considered, four hundred had been settled, while in certain others the process of liquidation had been suspended. The next step was to find an appropriate procedure for dealing with a large number of debatable cases. It was noticeable that while direct negotiations between the parties had had no result in this matter, negotiations under the auspices of the League had had some measure of success.
VIII.	In reply to M. DUFOUR, M. CATASTIHI said that no
important information regarding the troubles in Palestine was available excopt what appeared in the press. A number of communications on the subject had been received, but so far none substantial enough to be considered as a serious petition, though such communications would doubtless come in later. It was to be expected that the representative of the Mandatory Power would make a declaration at the Council.
Xn reply to Sir Arthur SALTER, Mr. HUSTON said thau it should be possible to relieve the lift-man of the duty of delivering documents to the various rooms, and thus to ensure that the lift should ply with greater frequency.

Is.- Le Secrétaire général annonce qu'il va partir pour Rome et Belgrade. Etant donné que certaines informations inexactes
ont paru dans la presse, il désire indiquer que la dai
de ce
voyage a Ôté fixée de manière à tenir compte de ses convenances personnelles. Il doit, en effet, être à Londres, pour une réunion importante, le 14 novembre, et il avait proposé au Gouvernement italien, qui l'avait déjà invité, de se rendre à Rome un peu avant la date qui a été définitivement fixée. C'est le Gouvernement italien qui a suggéré au Secrétaire général d'ajourner son voyage de manière à arriver à Rome après les fêtes qui vont y être célébrées.
2°.- Le Secrétaire général signale que le Secrétariat va se trouver dans une situation difficile en ce qui concerne le chapitre des frais de voyage pour les services généraux de la Société. Le crédit de 145.000 francs figurant au budget a êté porté à 245.000 à la suite d'un virement décidé par le Conseil.
Actuellement, 233.000 francs ont été dépensés et, le Conseil ne se réunissant pas avant janvier, un nouveau virement est impossible. La situation est très sérieuse, et il est essentiel d'établir que, jusqu'à la fin de l'année, les dépenses imputables à ce chapitre devront être limitées dans toute la mesure du possible, et qu'aucun fonctionnaire au-dessous du rang de directeur ne pourra voyager qu’avec l'autorisation du sous-secrétaire général chargé de 1'administrât ion intérieure.
En réponse à une question de M. COLEAN, le SECRETAIRE GENERAL dit que la mesure qu'il envisage ne s'appliquera qu'aux dépenses imputables au chapitre on question, les directeurs de sections qui disposent dans leurs budgets de crédits spéciaux pour des voyages pouvant continuer à appliquer la procédure ordinaire.
M, BIELER ayant fait remarquer que la situation est aussi assez sérieuse en ce qui concerne les crédits spéciaux prévus aux budgets de diverses sections, le SECRETAIRE GENERAL ajoute que les différents directeurs intéressés seront également informés par la Trésorerie do l'état de leurs dépenses sous ce chapitre, étant entendu d'ailleurs qu'à l'intérieur du budget de chaque section un transfert d'un poste à un autre peut être autorisé, en cas de besoin, par le Secrétaire général.
En réponse à une question de M. Comert, le Secrétaire général dit qu'il ne s'agit que de prendre une mesure provisoire rendue nécessaire par l'épuisement du crédit prévu au chapitre "Frais de voyage pour les services généraux de la Société".
3°0- M. Bieler signale que la discussion qui a eu lieu au sujet de la publication des proces-verbaux des Commissions semble avoir donné de bons résultats. On vient, eneffet, de lui envoyer les procès-verbaux de la quatrième Commission un mois après la session de l'assemblée.
- o -
4,	" M. ABRAHAM attire 11 attention sur les difficultés
qui résultent de la procédure de la quatrième Commission, Alors que les autres Commissions sont invitées à hâter leur travail 2.a plus possible, ce travail se trouve arrêté dans de nombreux ces parce eu5 il faut attendre aue la quatrième Commission prenne une décision d’ordre financier.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL fait remarquer que le Reglement financier de l’Assemblée va être révisé par la Commission de Contrôle* Il croit, cependant, que la situation signalée par M. Abraham est inévitable, La quatrième Commission veut pouvoir examiner ensemble les diverses propositions de crédits supplémentaires qui lui sont renvoyées, La seule chose possible est de s'efforcer de faire étudier, en premier lieu, lorsque c’est faisable, les questions qui peuvent impliquer des demandes de crédits additionnels .
5,	- M. C0L3AN exprime l’espoir que le souvenir des mauvaises conditions de travail de la dernière Assemblée, qui résultèrent surtout d’une température exceptionnelle, n’amènera pas le Comité des Cinq à se prononcer en faveur du transfert de l’Assemblée au Bâtiment électoral. Il signale, d’autre part, qu'il serait inopportun de substituer à la traduction orale des discours un système de traduction artificielle » Le maintien du système actuel lui paraît nécessaire pour des raisons politiques. De plus, il serait regrettable qu’en y renonçant on aboutît en pratique à éliminer l'anglais comme langue officielle de l'Assemblée.
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL fait remarquer que la prochaine Assemblée aura lieu, en tout cas, dans la salle de la Réformation.
Le Bâtiment électoral, s’il devait devenir salle d’Assemblée,
4
aurait besoin d'un certain nombre de transformations qui nécessiteraient des dépenses assez importantes. Le Comité hésitera sans doute avant de proposer d'entreprendre ces dépenses, l'Assemblée devant, dans 3 ou 4 ans, siéger dans sa nouvelle salle. En ce qui concerne les traductions, il est tout à fait d'accord que la traduction orale est nécessaire, ne serait-ce que pour permettre un contrôle immédiat sur l'exactitude d’une traduction et aussi; comme l'a signalé M. Colban, parce que, au point de vue politique, le temps consacré à la traduction peut être utilement employé par les délégations.

1. Mr. COnBhR said that he had ashed that the question of the winter hours ox work of the Secretariat should be placed on the .agenda not because he was opposed to the maintenance as
at present of the hours 9 to 5.30 instead of 9.30 to 6.0., but because ho definite decision had been arrived at when
the question of retaining the earlier hours in the winter was discussed a year before. He felt that such a matter should not be decided by the mere continuance of what was supposed to be a temporary state of affairs but that a definite decision should be taken on the basis of the experience of the two systems which had now been acquired, xi-t the former discussion some directors had been opposed to the retention of the early hours and he felt that perhaps the directors of the largest sections, e. g. , the Information and the Economic Sections, should now say what they felt
aoout xt.
2,
Mr0 L0Vj3D.-xY thought there was a slight adninis t r a t i v & advantage in observing the later hours; for instance the post did not cone in till about 10 o’clock and it was useful to start the day by clearing off correspondence. On the other hand, the feeling of his staff so far as he could ascertain it was in favour of the earlier hours because though in fact they would usually work until 6 or later, they could sometimes leave the office at 5C 30, which would not otherwise be possible. lie thought that the slight administrative advantage should not outweigh a general and strong desire of the staff.
Li. COMER! said that in spite of the difficulty of getting help from the tool,in the late afternoon, the Information Section had succeeded in adapting itself to the early hours and he saw no objection to retaining them if the sraff wanted them.
Ur. BIEH3R said that in the accountancy branch of the Treasur special arrangements had long been in force whereby the Junior Staff, which was nearly all Swiss and accustomed to start work early, kept the early hours. There were also technical reasons which made these hours preferable in the Accountancy branch. As
far as he himself was concerned, he sometimes found it hard to ge~ anyone from the rood after 5, but recently tilings had improved in
tnis respect;.
hr. PARESS said that the later hours would suit the Health Section better as most of its members worked until after & in any
GciSG •
Li. C-n-TASTIUI had no objection to retaining the early hours.
Mr. iicIZIItLiOU 'HOOD said that the early system did not affect the work of the Legal Section but ho had understood those hours’ to auulv only to the central services.

Hr, KuSiOdsaid that theoretically the office hours applied to the whole Secretariat but it should be realised, as had been made clear in the discussions of the year before, that in view of the conditions of word of the Secretariat no fined hours could be
strictly observed by the whole Secretariat.

seemed to	have given s&tisfac	tion	to the staff in	general and
owing to	special arrangoments	made	by the central	services he
did not f	eel that the work of	the	Secretariat had	suffe red.
He doubted therefore whether it would be wise to return to the former system merely for the sake of half an hour.
The ACTING SECRHIJLPT-&BH3RA.L thought it might be useful to ascertain how far the hours were actually observed by those members of the staff who could in fact observe them. He himself felt satisfied that they punctually observed the hour of departure; was it certain that they observed with equal punctuality the opening hour?
M. CaTASTIlhl asked whether since the earlier hours had been maintained for the, winter there had been any noticeable increase in overtime pay,
Mr. HUSTOH said that he had not very recent figures but that such as he had showed a slight decrease in payment for overtime as under the early system less time was worked after 8 p - m.
M. CATASTIHI thought that even under the early system most members of section on the whole viorked more than their seven hours.
M. C-"OLBAH thought that if office-hours were laid down, it was still not satisfactory that members of the Secretariat should excuse themselves for coming late in the morning by remaining late in the evening. There was something morally indefensible in hawing rules without observing them. He recognised on the other hand that in fact the upper and lower staff would always work different hours. All that could be said in favour of prescribing
i;he latex- h s was
the nominal
that the difference between and the real working hours would he less than it is now.
The mDIUiGt S£(JR¿ IaRY-G
L said that under the system
of	later	hours th	ere	WOUld	a	Iso	be less reason for	s ay iii£j	o na ts
the	ll 0 H.X" ¿0	of work	: in	the Se	c	rets	iriat were dictated	by the	cent r
services.
M. COiloxiiT said that in expressing his acquiescence in the present system he had "been under the impression that the early hours applied only to the central services. If this were not so he no longer acquiesced. The answer to the question whether the upper staff observed regular hours for beginning v.ork was simple.
They observed them with great strictness: with very few exceptions there was no- one of the upper staff at the office at 10.15 and everyone was there at in.30.
II. DUF0UK-FHR05IC2 said that all his whole section was at
work	by 9	.15 and as r	égards the question before	the	meeting he
-f ici u	that	the system	of early hours worked well	ana	he w ou Id b
in i av 0 nr		of keeping	r t •		
M. lUxxo saw no Harm in having separate hours for the central services and for the sections. He saw no reason why members of section who worked late should feel themselves under a cloud if they came late.
The ACIIIm’G SBC HI TaRY- Gill j ilkl observed that it appeared from the discussion that the system of early hours for the
central services did	not impede t	he actual	work of tiie	Secretar
He therefore did not	propose to	iter the p	resent syst	em of ear
hours but he felt it	should be no	tea ug a i n	that in his	opinion
it was abnormal that	office hours	should be	laid down	for the v;
Secretariat whicn, through force of circumstances, could not be observed by all its members.

The ,-i.CTIxVCr S3C3A!Dj*.RY~G-MbTRaIL said that the mates of the opening of the liaval Conference and the Session of the Council wer< Doth fixed for January £0th. It was possible that some effort might be made to change the aate of one of them but he had no information whether this would be cone.
K. GAIaSTIFI hoped that the date of the session of the Council would not be put forward, as his Section would find it very difficult to prepare its work in time.

Dame BACHEL CRODDY signale que, dans sa note, le Major Suxton sTest référé à la réimpression des rapports des trois Comités dont elle est seerétairec Elle fait remarquer que ces trois Comités ne siègent quTune fois par an, que leurs rapports sont en effet insérés au Journal officiel, mais que les délégués n'apportent pas avec eux le Journal. Les membres de la 5ème Commission ont trouvé commode d'avoir sous les yeux les trois rapports= D'ailleurs, la dépense n'est pas très grande, étant donné qu'il s'agit, non pas d'une impression, mais d'une réimpression de documentso
Mo CÜLBÂN dit qu'il est très difficile d'espérer que les délégués apportent dans les Commissions les procès-verbaux du Conseil. Au cours des séances, il arrive très fréquemment qu'ils demandent soit des procès-verbaux, soit d'autres documents souvent volumineux et ooûteuxc Personnellement, il recommande à sa Section de prêter les documents demandés, mais d'essayer de se les faire restituer. En ce qui concerne l'Assemblée, il est partisan du maintien de la pratique actuelle, les frais de réimpression d'extraits de quelques pages n'étant rien à coté de ce que seraient les protestations des délégués s'ils ne recevaient pas les documents qu'ils demandent.
Le Marquis PAULUCCI DI C/.L30LÏ BABOÏÏE est d'avis que s'il est bien de se préoccuper de faire des économies, il est nécessaire de ne pas tomber dans l'excès contraire et d'empêcher le travail des délégations» Il estime, d'autre part, qu'il est moins coûteux de réimprimer des documents que de distribuer, le cas échéant, des exemplaires du Journal officiel.

1.	The SECH3TARY-GENIIRAL said that he reared that the
meeting of the Hague Conference might prevent certain Foreign Ministers from coming to the Council,	The British Foreign
Minister having however expressed his intention of coming for the first two or three days, he hoped his presence was assured.
The Agenda of the Council was not particularly heavy.
The session should, he thought, be finished without difficulty within the week, which seemed to belie the fears felt lest the reduction of the number of the sessions of the Council would cause future sessions to be unduly prolonged.
XX.	M. ATE SOL, referring to the Conference on the Treatment
of foreigners, said that its failure had shown that League conferences were less likely to succeed if thewore he lg away from Geneva. In tnis case xnc members of the Conference had
O
III»
either been technical experts or diplomats resident in ¿aris and they had not constituted a sufficiently7 home gene ous body for negotiation.	Many of them were ignorant of League of
Nations methodso	It was not certain that the Conference
would have succeeded in Geneva, but it would have had a better chance, and would not have been so prolonged.
Secondly, there seemed to be a feeling that international diplomatic conferences of this kind must, like the Assembly, aim at resolutions having a universal application»
In fact, however, conferences might often do good work if they resulted in an agreement between a limited number of States, Something might be done to remove this feeling that a umiver S 8, ny accepted convention was the only proper result of a conference.
The S3CE3TARY-GEEEBAL said that the experience at Paris showed that every effort should	be	made in the future	to
insist that	League conferences should	be	held in Geneva»
This did not apply to the Codification Conference, because there had been exceptional reasons for choosing the Hague. It should be remembered that the argument used to prevail upon the Council to hold the	Treatment of Foreigners Conference in Paris and	been
that it was	likely to be boycotted by7	an	important category	of
States if it were held in Geneva.
U. EERHO said that march 24th had been provisicnaliy accepted as the date of the meeting of the Arbitration and Security Committee. He understood that Benes, if he ascertained that the Governments did not object to this date, would formally propose it to the Secretary-General.
Mr. BIELER wondered whether such material difficulties in view of the March Codification Conference at the Hague.

M. PHIIS said that it was to be expected that the Mandates Commission would hold a special session at the end of March.
The SE CHETARY-SE HERAL hoped that the session of the Mandates Commission could be put off until the 4th or 5th of April, which would still make it possible for it to finish before Easter. Incidentally he trusted that for general and financial reasons the Mandates Commission would not meet in the South of Prance.	It was to bo expected ti,at the Mandates Commission,
the members of which now received, alone of all League Commissions, and not without resistance in the assembly, a special honorarium, should forego indulgences of the 'rind.
M. PEI IS said that such influence as th C fcLB d ate s Section possessed would be used in the direction indicated by the Secretary—Ge mra1.
The SBCE3TABY-CmKBRAL, acting on a suggestion made to him by M. Dufour-S'dronce, drew attention to the fact that sometimes members of the Secretariat mo bad represented the Secretariat at international conferences did not make any official report. He asked that in future such a report should always be written, even though it might on occasion bo necessary to supplement it by a confidential report.

Aide - mémoire
concerning the publication of the commissions and su b-commissi ons of the League of Nat ions :-
The Ninth .assembly of the League of Nations has passed a resolution, according to which the minutes of comnittaes and sub-committees will in no case be published unless a formal reouest, containing statement of the reasons for such a course is submitted to the Council through the Seei etary-Genera 1 ,
The Opium and Health Committees, having met since this Assembly, have both petitioned the Council for permission to have their minutes printed. The decision of the Council (at its next session, beginning December 10th at Lugano),

in tba se two cases will probably form the precedent fox all the committee s«
The publication for all the minutes of the committees and sab -comm it fees is of 7ital importance to the League of Nations. The League expert-comm it tees do the real constructive work: cf the League,
A Ion owl edge of their diiscusMons is essential to understanding ox the problems with which the Teague deals. In case of no publication the
minutes of the Economic, the Finance, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, the Arbitration and Security committees, the Codification or International Law committee and so many other committees w cu Id no longe? be Known,
The support of public opinion, and especially of expert public opinion is of the greatest importance for the League, 3ut no public interest can subsist without detailed Knowledge. For League activities axe uninteresting in vague and generalised outline, but extremely interesting in detail. To the expert it is precisely the detail of the discussions that is valuable; the generalities embodied in the reports are common-place.
There is an other important point of view* The League has
always succeeded in enlisting for its service the greatest technical
ex. arts of every country. The League .ays their expanses in Geneva,
but will never be able to pay salaries to these distingu ished helpers*
whose service is voluntary and given at great personal inconvenience.
Those exuerts serve becsuse they believe that by giving their advice cn
League-committees, they may get the support of the world at large., It
is surely discourteous to the members not to record their opinion and suggestions in any way. Moreover, if they are to be unable to show
the discussions to administrative de mar tmsnt s and nr ofe ssi cnal bodies in their own country, their work will be largely wasted. In such circumstances many of the members will not feel it worth their while to attend League committees, which will diminish rapid!, in usefulness and prestige .

I have read Professor Gilbert Murray's and Mr. Banys Myers1 letters concerning league publications. Tho following suggestion, if carried out, might perhaps do something to shorten tho present delay in the issue of Advisory Committee Minutes, although admittedly it is only a secondary measure. I think: Council Mimit3s get into print and into the hands of the public a good deal quieter than any other Minutes, The main reason for that is that Members of the Council are ashed every day for their corrections to the previous day's Minutes, with the result that the final edition goes to the printer very few days after the meetings have taken place. I think if all Committees followed this procedure, a good deal of delay would he avoided, hut of course tho staff oannot possibly get out even provisional minutes promptly, if a rroiabar of different committees are meeting simultaneously.

RECORD OF INTERVIEW:
M. 30KA.L came to see me this morning. Ee said to me that 1929 would see the tenth anniversary of the League's foundation, and ha ashed what, if any, methods were contemplated to celebrate it.
I replied that personally I .• id not much like such manifestations, hut that I had hoped that the present year might he marked by the laying of the foundation stone of the new buildings, which might be made an occasion ox emphasising the tenth anniversary of the League. Various prominent personalities connected with League work might be invited to come to such a ceremony.
IT. Sokal said that, apart from that, he had thought that it might be a good plan to issue a book containing an account of the League's work during the last decade and establishing some sort of a balance sheet.
I remarked that I believed that the Information Section were already undertaking such a work.
II.	Sokal said that it had occurred to him that it might be possible to include in this work statements from various Governments Members of the league, giving an account of their relationship with the league during these ten years.
Apart from its publicity value, such declarations w cu Id constitute a profession of faith, and might, therefore, have considerable value in binding Members of the League even mere closely to it than at present.

PRAPI AOS' -'A OF THE TENTH OPDINARY ASSEMBLY.
POTS B? TEE SECRETARY-GENERAL.
The attached draft Assembly agenda is circulated to Undersecretaries, Directors and Chefs de Section for purposes of discussion at the next Directors1 Meeting. Consideration might then be given to the following point s*.-
(1)	It appears to me that the time has come when we might
substitute for items 1 - 5 a single item entitled "Items of
»1»
Procedure” or ’’Election of Credentials Committee , Election of President and Other Items of Procedure.” I think: we should have either one comprehensive it an like this or else ^iould be more explicit. As a matter of fact, delegates are guided in regard to procedure questions, not by the formal agenda, but by the note on the existing practice which the Secretariat prepares and by the proposals of the President, and these are more explicit than the five items at present given. In fact, I believe that the best plan would be to omit these items altogether, adding the following footnote to this number of the Agenda: "Items of Procedure, viz., Appointment of Credentials Committee, Election of President, etc., lave not been inserted in this number of Uie Agenda. A note on the order customarily followed by the Assembly in dealing with these items is prepared for the use of d elegates at the beginning of the session”.
(2)	The item ’’Report on the Work: of the Council, etc.” might be given in capitals, to emphasise its special importance, and the title might be changed to one which could be readily remembered and
* Could we not call this the "Credentials Committee” instead of the Committee to Report, on the Credentials of Delegates.”?
wn i en
—2-
would at the same tme be more .exact» e,g,, ’'Report of the Work of the League since the lest General Session of the Assembly3 r
(3)	As rega. Is the work of the Technical Committee, I
suggest the deletion of the words T1Repor+ on the«...:.»*” ana
the sub itemso These items refer, in fact, to the whole
work of the respective organisations for the past year, and it
seems confusing to mention special reports submit tec! to the
Council, e.g» the report of the Child Welfare Committee* In
so far as these reports have been communicated to the Members
«
of the League, they are, of course, at the disposal of the Assembly and can be dealt with. But the Assembly is seised of all the work of the organisations for the past year through the report on the work cf Hie Council..;
Perhaps the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Administration would consider whether we should nor include, as separate items
'(a) A report on the Staff Regulations
(b ) A report on the new building's.
The Disarmament Section will, no doubt, make suggestions as to the best course to follow in relation in Disarmament questions, end the Political Section as to that as regards Security and Arbitration matters, having regard to the procedure followed in this connection last year*

1.	Election of Three Won-Permartent Members of the
Council.
(a)	Resolution adopted on September 15th, 1926.

As the General Committee had to fix a date for the voting and the elections, it has thought fit to make a general proposal to the Assembly on this subject. This proposal, if adopted, would, to a certain extent, and until the Assembly decides otherwise, be regarded as a rule which the Assembly would follow at future sessions.
The election of the non-permanent Members of the Council would take place on the Monday following the opening dare of the Assembly - that is to say, at the beginning of the second week of the session.
2.	Slavery Convention: Annual Report by the Council.

7. Progressive Codification of International law.
Extract from resolution adopted on September 14th
1928. II.
II. PEEIAnATCRY WORK EGA FURTHER CONFERENCES.
1. Che Assembly,
Having considered the report addressed to the Council of the League of Nations in June 1926 by the Committee of Experts for
the Progressive Codification of International law, thanxs the ¿jurists who, under the enlightened guidance of their president,
■10-
have made this new contribution to the work of codification,
It notes the conclusions of the Committee, according' to which two new questions appear to he sufficiently ripe for international regulation, namely;
(1)	legal position and functions of Consuls;
(2)	Competence of the Courts in regard to foreign States.
It decides to reserve these questions with a view to
subsequent conferences,
2.	The Assembly notes that a new questionnaire dealing
with the question of Domicil has been drawn up by the Committee of Experts and transmitted to the Governments by the Secretary-General .
It adjourns to Its session of 1129 the question v/hethe; It is necessary to convene the Committee of Experts again for the purpose of examining the replies from the Governments received in the interval by the Secretary-General of the League cf Bations, and, eventually, of studying other questions which may arise ip. connection with codification of international law.
The Assembly recommends that the Committee of Experts
should, when	q -f -i. U	uexb meets,	examin
and desirable	“b u	o endeavour,	"h tr T In p U v yi.C
to formulate	a.	declaration	of the
of States.			
hi, establish-.:eiji of a geeeral aiai; oi com iCAi-lci
The Assembly:
Having considered the opinion expressed by the Committee of Experts regarding the proposal ox the delegation
-11-
Confirms its decision to maize no change at present in the method of condification adopted by it in 1924:
Recognises, however, that there would be advantages in indicating the full extent of the subjects which, without prejudging the order to be followed, the Assembly proposes to cover by the worn of codification;
And, in view of the character of the contemplated task, addresses to the Council the request that the establishment of a systematic survey may be entrusted to a committee of three jurists, to be chosen preferably from the members of the Committee of Experts, and that the survey may be communicated to the Members of the League as soon as possible.
It suggests . that it would be desirable at the same time to distinguish, if possible, the subjects which should be reserved for the technical organisations of the League, or the international conferences which have already been initiated by particular Governments, and the subjects which appear capable of being dealt with by conferences of jurists.
The Assembly emphasises the great immediate practical value in this connection of assembling together in the form of a code, according to a methodical classification, the various general international conventions, i.e. those which are open
to acceptance by States in general.
It accordingly asks the Council to submit to examination by the above-mentioned committee of three jurists the question of publishing, as an accompaniment to the Treaty Series and in the form of a code, of which new editions v/ould from time to time be produced, those general conventions which have
;he above-mentioned character, and to report to the Assent: >n the matter at its next session.

Directors' Meeting Paper 10.19E9.
METHOD OP PREPARAT I OK OF DEPORT TO THE A53KMBLY.
I have been looking at certain chapters of the report to the Assembly on the work of the league for the past year. While I admire the industry which has been shown in its preparation, I fear that the final result will not be very satisfactory.
I understand that formerly the report was written by its present editors, the Précis Writing Section, and its various parts then checked by the Sections concerned.
More recently, however, it has been the oustom for the Sections to write their own parts of the report and the editors, finding, I am told, that abridgements and other changes which an editor with his eye on the work as a whole would be inclined to introduce, were disliked by Sections, do little more than draft the French and English texts.
The report therefore tends to be an amorphous compilation, without unity of style or design, without proportion, and so involved in a network of administrative terminology as to be almost unreadable.
To my mind the report is not Intended to roplade the minutes and other documents of the various organs of the League, but to give a readable and well-balanced account of the work for the year, as complete as possible, but touching on questions of minor importance largely by means of foot-note references to the various documents.
It may be too late to make any changes as regards the main report for this year but I should like to see the
2 -
supplementary report written on these lines.
The question, so far as I see, is whether the editors 'should, as in former years, write the report themselves, or whether it is enough that they should exercise real powers of editing the chapters written by the Sections.
It should be easy to ensure, by collaboration between the editors and the sections, the treatment of subjects in the order and with the emphasis, though not always in the detail, which the Sections may desire.	Such collaboratio
should be particularly close in the case of politically delicate subjects.
I should like this question to be discussed at a Directors1 Meeting, with the assistance of the editor of

It charged the Organising Committee to make "representatione to the Belgian Government in order that the latter might commence pourparlers with the League of Rations with a view to the definite constitution of this Permanent Secretariat as well as of the other Commissions which the Conference had decided, in principle, to establish1’ (Pinal Protocol and Draft International Arrangement, Articles 34, 38)

August 19th, 1929.
AH RANG'. PANTS FOR TEE TENTH STS'SION CF THE ASSEMBLY 0
Tho attached note prepared by M, de Montenach is distributed as a basis for discussion at' the next Directors* meetir
At the last meeting I asked the Directors to consider, with a view to discussion at the next meeting, the question whether it might not be desirable to increase the number of Vice-Presidents of the Assembly from six to eight. In case a desire for such an increase should appear at the Assembly, it might be useful to consider forthwith the procedure by vdiich effect could be given to it.
Rule 7, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly reads:
"The Officers of the Assembly shall consist of a President and of six Vice-Presidents, together with the Chairman of the main Committees of the Assembly, who shall be ex officio Vice-Presidents of the Assembly.
These officers shall form the General Committee”.
(It has also been the custom at recent sessions of the Assembly for the President to propose to the Assembly that the Chairman of the Agenda Committee should also be a member of the General Committee).
Rule 28 of the Rules cf Procedure reads:
"These Rules of Procedure may be altered by a decision of the Assembly; but no such alteration shall be made except upon a majority vote of the Assembly, taken after a committee has reported on the proposed alteration",
*
5k	v=

2
If it is desired to increase the number permanently, an amendment to Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure will he required. The necessary amendment might be moved by a delegate on the occasion of the election of the six Vice-Presidents (see Point 6 cf the proposed agenda for the Assembly on Monday afternoon, on page 2 of M, de Montenach's note}»
According to the Rules, the matter should then be referred to a Committee, It may perhaps be question»! whether the General Committee is a "committee" in the sense of Rule 28, but if it is, I think the General Committee could most suitably report on the subject» The General Committee might itself propose, or the Assembly decide, to refer the matter also to the First Committee, though I see no advantage in this»	If this
procedure is to be adopted, the General Committee would have to be constituted with its six Vice-Presidents as usual, the additional Vice-Presidents being elected if and when the Assembly decides on the amendment of the Rules,
We should of course have to prepare a reasoned statement for the delegate who moves the amendment.

Les secrétaires de Commissions devront indiquer clairement, aussitôt que possible, aux Commissions dont ils sont respectivement chargés, les documents qui seront mis à leur disposition et qui contiennent des éléments d’information sur les questions qui leur sont soumises.
Procès-xsrbaux des CommissionsP
Au cours des sessions précédentes, le Bureau de l'Assemblée adoptait généralement le texte d’une note concernant les procès-verbaux des Commissions et cette note était communiquée ensuite aux délégations par la voie du Journal de 17Assemblée.
L'an dernierj au cours de la neuvième session, le Bureau a cru opportun de donner à cette communication le caractère d'une proposition de principe, c'est-à-dire pouvant, dans une certaine mesure, être considérée comme une règle qui serait suivie au cours de sessions ultérieures de l’Assemblée et jusqu'à ce que celle-ci en décide autrement.
_ 9
Le Président de lrAssemblés fit part aux délégations cle cette décision du Bureau au début de la cinquième séance olanière de l’Assemblée, tenue le jeudi 6 septembre 192a, et l’Assemblée approuva les dispositions qui avaient été prises, notamment le sens et la portée que le Bureau avait entendu donner à sa communication.
Il semble que, dans ces conditions, il n'y ait point lieu de solliciter le Bureau, au cours de la dixième session, de renouveler sa communication antérieure. Il suffirait que le texte de la note adopté l’an dernier soit reproduit dans le premier numéro du Journal de l’Assemblée de 1329. avec, s'il y a lieu, une-référence à la communication faite à l’Assemblée au cours de la séance du 6 septembre 1928,
' Procès-verbaux d’autres Commissions appelées à se réunir pendant la session,
Si d’autres Commissions que les Commissions générales de l'Assemblée se réunissaient au cours de la session, il appartiendrai aux sections intéressées de prendre les dispositions nécessaires en vue de la rédaction des procès-verbaux de ces Commissions.
“ Coordination des travaux des Commissions et préparation de leurs rapports.
Il est désirable que la marche des travaux des Commissions et que l’ordre dans lequel les questions diverses seront abordées par elles soient réglés, autant que possible, à l'avance.
Il y aurait avantage à ce que les rapporteurs, chargés de présenter à l’Assemblée des résolutions adoptées par les Commissions fussent désignés dès que faire se pourra» Afin d’assurer la coordination des travaux des différentes Commissions, une réunion des secrétaires aura lieu, sur convocation, dans le bureau du Secrétaire général-adjoint avant la séance de l’Assemblée, de façon que le
- 10 -
Secrétaire général puisse etre quotidiennement tenu au courant du progrès des discussions et adapter en conséquence l'ordre du jour des séances plénières.
Pour faciliter la préparation de l'ordre du jour dans ce sens, les secrétaires des Commissions devront, comme ils l'ont fait antérieurement, informer par des notes quotidiennes le Secrétariat de la Présidence de l'état des travaux de leurs Commissions respectives. Une copie de cette note devra etre régulièrement adressée au Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Sarone.
Questions de personnel et de matériel.
Afin de permettre d'adapter le fonctionnement des Services intérieurs aux dispositions prises au cours des réunions des secrétaires de commissions convoquées par le Secrétaire jénéral-adjoint, un représentant du Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone devra y assister.
Les Services intérieurs, les Secrétaires et Services administratifs régleront directement., comme jusqu'ici, toute question de matériel ou de personnel
chefs des ils l'ont fait
qui pourrait
se poser sans avoir pu être prévue.
.Publications éditées par le Secrétariat,
Conformément à ce qui fut fait au cours des sessions antérieures, le Secrétariat éditera pendant l'Assemblée les
publications suivantes :
a)	Journal de l'Assemblée contenant des résumés très succincts établis par le Secrétariat sans être
soumis aux délégations et n1 ayant aucun caractère officiel ;
b)	comptes rendus in extenso des séances plénières;

DATE OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE

The question of those dates affects in the first degree African and North American and secondly European countries. It can, I imagine, make little difference to those far distant. I think M.

DATE DTJ RAPPORT ANMUEL DU CONSEIL A L 'ASSEMBLEE.
En réponse à votre mémorandum du 16 août et après consultation aveo MF. Palmer, Schnabel, il rae semble qu'en ce qui concerne la date de publication du Rapport du Conseil à l’Assemblée — dans le passé et à l'avenir - les choses se présentent comme suit:
1.	Le rapport a été distribué cette année rigoureusement à la meme date qu'en 1918 et en 193 7.
2.	Les difficultés d'impression qui se sont produites sont expliquées par M. Schnabel dans sa lettre au Dr. Dixon en date du 20 juin (annexe 1. ). Elles semblent avoir un caractère de noimalité. Chaque année il y a apparemment en juin des travaux extraordinaires urgents: Cette année, les procès-verbaux du désarmement; l'an prochain
les procès-verbaux de la Conférence de codification, etc.
3.	M. Schnabel m'assure que si le manuscrit du Rapport annuel est remis entre ses mains au début de juin, comme il l’a été, entre autre, cette année, et comme il appert de la lettre du Dr.Dixon (annexe 2), il lui est impossible de procéder à la distribution avant le 12 juillet.
Pour que le Rapport puisse paraître désormais le 1er juillet
au plus tard, il se présente deux solutions:
1°— Augmenter le personnel de correcteurs, etc. dont dispose M. Schnabel. Avec un personnel adéquat, et qu'il lui appartiendrait de déterminer, il est techniquement possible de distribuer le 1er juillet le Rapport dont les derniers chapitres sont entre ses mains à la date du 10 juin.
2°- Décider que le Rapport principal de 1930 couvrira la période non plus de septembre 1929 - 15 mai 1930, mais de septembre 1929 au 1er mai 1930 environ. De cette façon on gagnerait les douze ou quinze jours voulus.
La conséquence de cette mesure serait naturellement que certaines importantes matières (travaux de divers comités siégeant habituellement en mai, etc.) ne pourraient être traitées que dans le Rapport supplémentaire. Le Rapport principal à 1’Assemblée perdrait une partie de son intérêt d'actualité, et le Rapport supplémentaire qui couvrirait les mois de mai, juin, juillet et début d'aout, tendrait à être presque aussi gros que le Rapport principal.

Annual Report to the Assembly on the Work of the Council.
All the manuscript of the general report to the Assembly was drafted before I left for Madrid on June 1st, with the exception of the chapters on the Health Organisation and the Construction of an Assembly Hall, of New Buildings for the Secretariat and of a Library.	With the exception
of the same two chapters, it was all sent to the Printing Department on June 6th. The Health chapter was sent on June 10th, and the chapter on the Construction of an Assembly Hall on June 7th.
On my return from Madrid on June 19th, I was told that owing to pressure of other work there would be some difficulty in completing the document by July 5th, the date which I had named. M. Schnabel was good enough, at my request, to send me the enclosed note explaining the difficulties of the situation. As a matter of fact, the report was delivered on July 11th, as he had promised, and distributed on July 12tli.	I may add that for the past three years
July 12th has been the date of distribution, the copies having been delivered twenty-four or forty-eight hours previously,

PRECIS WRITING SECTION,
Note by the Secretary-General.
My attention was drawn at the Directors' Meeting of yesterday to the fact that the report on the work of the League was issued this year only on July 12th. I understand that you informed the Secretary-General’s office at the time of certain printing difficulties which made it impossible to issue it earlier but I think it is desirable that in future the report should leave the Secretariat not later than the 1st of duly, and I should be grateful if you would examine the matter accordingly.
Perhaps also you would let me have a short memo op the printing difficulties in question, so that I shall be in a position tc make an adequate reply to anyone who raises the matter.

M. AVENOL said that he agreed with Ma^or Buxton's note, and he proposed that the question should be submitted at a Directors1 Meeting.
The Committee agreed to this proposal but M. van Asch v. Wijck was afraid that the delegates would not regularly bring with them the necessary documents for a given Committee; and that small extracts had their value inasmuch as they prevented the distribution of large volumes of sometimes over 100 pages........................................................."
PUBLICATIONS CQI1HI FT 313. Reprints fo r th0 As9cm bl.y
The Publications Committee decided to consider this question after the Tenth Assembly, As an example of the present practice the report on Opium by the Canadian reprasentativ3 to the Council, together with the Opium Committee Ts report to the Council, including all the annexes to that report, were reprinted for the use of the Assembly, (Ac 16). All these documents wore available in full in the
Journal, for the Opium Committee report was discussed by the Council in March, A similar procedure was followed in regard to the Traffic in Women and. Child Welfare, It seems to mo
that as a general rule the Report an.d the Supplementary Report of the Secretary-General contain sufficient information for all general purposes and they should be the bib la of every delegate to whatever committee he goes. If a Rapporteur on any particular question or any other delegate wishes to go into greater detail, he has only to refer to the Journal, or, with regard to a very recent meeting of the Council, to the separate printed minutes of the meeting. Every delegation surely must bring with them at least one copy of recent issues of the Journal, ¿¿ulte apart from the question of expense and of flooding delegates with documents, it is surely a good thing to make them look in the proper place if they wish detailed information about the Council’s work, namely in the Official Journal.
I think after discussion in the ‘Publications Committee the question might most conveniently be raised at a directors* meet ing,

I attach a minute which I have written to in reply to a question from him.
Coloan
(Initialled) E,D.
December 3rd. 1.929.
Hr. COLBii:,
I doubt whether any useful purpose can be served by reopening the discussions which took place at the Directors’ meeting on November 13th.
The position is; to my mind, as follows L Nominally the hours of 9 - 5,,30 apply to the whole Secretariat.
2. The nominal hours are observed fairly strictly by the Central Services. The Sections, however, whether the senior or junior staff, do not observe these hours at all strictly. Moreover, it seems fairly clear that, while the work of Sections depends on meetings of Commissions which sit late and on various other factors over which the Secretariat has no control., it is impossible to insist on the strict observance of the hours by all Sections.
3.	It might be possible that there should be separate hours laid down for the Central Services and the Sections, e. g», the hours for the Sections should be 10 ~ 6,30. It is admitted that even these hours can hardly be strictly observed by Sections, the members of which often have to stay much later than 5.30, but
it might be that under such a system the discrepancy between the nominal and the real hours would be somewhat less than it is now. On the other hand, I attach some weight to the point made by Mr. Loveday and others that, especially as regards the clerical staff, it is reasonable that while they are very often called upon to work very late, they should be able to leave the office at 5.30 for business or recreative purposes if there is nothing to keep them, whereas with the office hours fixed at 6.30 it would be impossible for this to happen.
4.	There seems to be general agreement that, in view of recent arrangements by which some members of the Central Services are at the disposal of the Sections for urgent work until a late hour, the present system does not affect to any important degree the working efficiency of the Secretariat, This being so, if it can be shewn - and I think it can - thee the average length of time worked hy every member of the Secretariat is at least 7 hours a day (excluding luncheon time), I feel that we need not fear any scrutiny or criticism.

I circulate for the consideration of, and such action as is possible by the various responsible officers, some short notes by major Buxton and M.Schoell with regard to certain tendencies in the official
documents of the League.
I quite realise that the matter is difficult to remedy; but the suggestion that, whenever practicable, minutes and reports should be revised by members of the Section whose mother-tongue is either English or Pranch, should certainly be adop ted.

I have always h sen more or less aware that in the league, as in most organisations, there is a tendency to drift unconsciously into a peculiar method of expression; that tendency in the League is naturally intensified by translation.
An Englishman returning homo from the Soudan via Seneva, when ashed what he thought of the league, replied: "Oh, I dcrrt know, but you do talk a funny language.n When absent from Geneva for six months, I occasionally read a few League documents and the truth of the remark went home. It often is a "funny language", and, in view of the importance of public opinion and public understanding of League work, I think we ought to try to maintain a simpler style.
People in countries speaking the official league languages are of course likely to bo much mere critical of League style than the others, but for all of them the simpler the language the better.
Here are a few examples hurriedly pi deed from the last papers I have read, the minutes of the Lugano session, ITo doubt many others could be found in which I myself should be more or less to blame. Lhe language could in each case be simplified and there are several instances, which I have underlined, of french-Lnglish hybrids,

DAT5 OF IE5 SUMMER SESSION OF TES COUNCIL.
NOTE By the SECRETARY GENERAL.
The President of the Association of Journalists accredited to the League came to see me recently to explain the difficulties which would arise for the Press if the Meeting of the Council took place on the 3rd June, since the International Labour Conference had been summoned for the 30th May.
I replied that, while I understood these difficulties, they had occurred in previous years, and it had been found possible to overcome them. I did not therefore see any need to try to obtain a change of dates.
The President then said that this might hold good if the two meetings took places in C-eneva; but he understood that it was highly probable that the summer meeting of the Council would be held in Madrid. If this were so, the clash of dates would render the Press work almost impossible. Could not, therefore, something be done to advance the date of the Council Meeting, or to postpone that of the International Labour Conference ?
I answered that, up to now, although I had heard various rumours, I had no information, either official or semi-official, from the Spanish Representative to the effect that he intended to issue invitations to the Council to come to Madrid. There were obviously certain financial difficulties, but, of course, these might be overcome through the generosity of the Spanish Government. The main difficulty in changing the date of the Council Meeting was that the various Advisory committees settled the dates of their meetings, having in view those fixed for the Council, and to make a change might disorganise the system. I would however, give his observations careful and full consideration,
2
After this interview, 1 had a talk with hr. Butler, and he told me that if it were feasible to put the date of the Council Meeting forward by a week, viz., that it should meet on the 27th hay and not on the 3rd June, he thought that it would not be difficult to arrange for his Governing Body to postpone the opening of the Labour Conference till the 3rd June, Such an arrangement would clearly give great satisfaction to the Journalists.
In view of the strong line I have taken up in the past when proposals reached me from the different members of the Council for a change of date, I do not think that it would be feasible for me to make any suggestion to the Council on the subject; but if h. Quinones de Leon intends to issue invitations to the Council to meet in Madrid, and if satisfactory financial arrangements are assured, it might perhaps be possible for him to suggest that the Meeting should take place on the 27th May, since the climate of Madrid becomes somewhat too hot in June.
Before, however, proceeding any further 'with the matter, I should be glad if the various Sections interested would let me know whether such a change of date would lead to any serious diifi cu±uies as regards the work of the Advisory committees.

LEAGUE LANGUAGE.
Note "by Capt. Walters.
SECRETARY-GENERAL:
The difficulties in the way of improvement of League style are very well pointed out in Ur. Schoell’s note. It ' must also he remembered that documents of an official character are bound, as a general rule, to be couched in a somewhat inelegant language. They cannot, call a spade a spade, but are bound to mate provision, in dealing with suades, fox shovels, hoes and other agricultural implements of an analogous character.	There is no doubt room for improvement, but we
cannot hope ever to reach a very high standard Judged from the purely literary point of view.
what is to my mind specially striking in Major Buxton' note* is that two of the paragraphs which he picks out as being especially bad, are taken straight from the Resolutions of the Assembly. This is not surprising to me, for I think everyone will agree that the drafting of Assembly resolutions, taken as a whole, tends to be extremely bad. This is due partly to the fact that they generally represent a compromise between the various points of view expressed in the Committee which ad outs them, and partly to their being always drafted in a hurry.
This state of things is difficult to remedy, but it is certainly unfortunate because the Assembly resolutions are, in a sense, the most important, -of all the League documents.
» 2
1 fancy that a good ia al of inrrovement could ba made if the question is taken in hand in good time, and if the centers of the Secretariat specially concerned give attention to it hefcrehand „
One of the chief reasons why these texts read so hadly is that most Committees take it for granted that every sentence in every resolution must have the words "The Assembly" for its subject, and that all incidental remarks must he worked into sentences so constructed. The result is that the various sentences dealing with the reasons on which the resolution is based, or Mth the reservations and qualifications by which it is accompanied, are contorted into a single sentence which is perhaps not grammatically incorrect hut which offends against every canon of literary style, Examples will he found on every page of the Assembly resolutions. X might refer, for instance, to the general resolution on Refugees (Assembly Resolutions 1928, page 66], where there is a series of about 20 sub-sentences all with the same subject, and beginning with all the stock verbs;-
" re commend s	........
"earnestly invites ............ .
points out , ho we ver .........
"notes that ...................
"declares that ...............
"recalls with gratitude ......
" c o gn i sant of .......
"expresses the hope that ..... etc. etc* etc.
This would be an example of the very worst kind, except that it at least does not begin with a series of "Whereas-e s" .
a
There are at least two obvious ways in which these resolutions could ha improved. In the first place, there is a great tendency to put in the resolution a large quantity of matter which ought if possible to form part of the report, An example of this is the resolution on Intellectual Cooperation and it is a frequent characteristic ox the resolutions of the Second Committee,
In the second place, it would be a great improvement if it were an agreed principle that an Essembly resolution could, without disaster, include sentences complete in themselves and not having the words "The Assembly" for their subject. resolution I (2) adopted by the fourth Committee is an example of this, the only one I have come across in a
cursory glance at the resolutions of 1928, except for that.
Sion Alcoholism, page 15, which, after a desperate effort to
beep up to the mark, is pathetically forced to put in a
separate sentence: "It is understood that this resolution
does not refer to wine, beer or cyder'7.
I expect that a careful study of the question,
which I think: is well worth making, would produce other
remedies to fit different cases.

Secre tar,y-Ge neral.
I agree heartily with Captain Walters’ remarks about the language of Assembly resolutions. Luring the Assembly so many documents are being issued at the same time it is impossible for any one department to revise the drafting of all of them, but Assembly resolutions (apart from Conventions) only amounted to about 20 pages of print last year and I would gladly undertame to revise them with a French member of the staff.
The difficulty is to know when to start, for many of these resolutions get into more or less5 final form in the hands of a sub-committee , who may object to drafting changes in a reso Nation they have already adopted and sent to the main committee. Perhaps the
test plan would be for secretaries of committees to pass through the drafting committee any draft resolution eventually intended for the Assembly, whether it comes from a sub-committee or a main committee. A responsible member of the Section who has attended the discussions

ensure that no change is maae m one sense.	I would
try to undertake to craft Assembly reports as well as the resolutions, but if they are very long and ail come through about the same time I might want some assistance.

who are important from the League viewpoint, including the new Secretary of State, Colonel Stimson, who gave me two meetings, and the new Under-Secretary, Mr. Cotton, with whom I had lunch; for the other Departments of interest to us, I twice saw Dr. Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, and lunched with Julius Klein, Under Secretary of Commerce; and for Congress secured a certain cross-
sectional view by discussions with Senators Walsh, Svnnso Burton, Carper and. Walcott and Congressman Hull. Outside of strictly governmental connections, ü had several inters ing talks with Mr. Root, a friendly meeting with Dr. Ecus of the Pan-American Union, a very fortunate conversation with the Rockefeller group and several meetings with the Directors of the larger unofficial organisations influenci public opinion.
General Conclusions:	I believe there is absolutely
no ground whatsoever for questioning the statement that American co-operation with the League is at a more satisfactory point than it has ever been since IS20. The
ground gained by the slow but consistent progress of the past ten years is now firmly consolidated in fact and in
2
public opiuion and many of the old. troubles ara now things of the past.
There is the highest authority for saying that this co-operation is going to continue and to accentuate in the coming years. The new mdministrati on is not only in itself more friendly to the League but is convinced that public opinion is also. ms a very high official expressed it, all the "nonsense" about the League has practically disappeared from American opinion; the opposition, though still strong, is constantly weakening; and the public has thoroughly accepted the League as a "useful, helpful, and at the very least harmless, agency of international cooperation with which at times it is decidedly an American interest to collaborate".
This means, then, that the League may expect more frequent, more active and more normal co-operation by the United States Government in all types of work where the interests of that Government or the general interests of the world are involved. Already, as I aid not hesitate to emphasise to Mr. Hoover, American representatives are aresent at practically ail the general and technical conferences and committees; that that will continue and accentuate is beyond doubt.
This does net at all States is shortly going t the animosities created i to permanent commitments thing else, the overwhelming absorption in domestic aiiairs, make it inevitable that American progress in League relationship will evolve slowly and carefully in tne coming years as
. That is most desirable here, if seems
5	ho we	ver, tha	t the United
join	the	League.	Unfortunately,
1920,	the	general	hesitation as
road,	and	perhaps	more than any-
it has in the past
- 3 -
to me, is a continuation of the friendly, patient and understanding attitude which has brought the American relationship from an almost unbridgeable distance in 1S20 to the very close contact -of to-day.
League supporters on this side, it would seem to me, should have in mind two factors regarding the United States: the first is, that from their point of view, in dealing with the United States, the League is an advantage and not
a disadvantage. Whatever may be seid of the American people, their psychology is based on a decided Puritanism, with a stern sense of duty, and their feelings towards the League, both friendly and hostile, are decidedly intensified by a doubt as to whether the nation which they like to think is the most idealistic in the world is really living pro to its full duties as a member of the community of nations when it is not taking an adequate part in the most important mechanism for world peace and co-operation ever devised.
The second factor is that, no matter how dide-spread American co-operation may be in certain specific League activities, it must never be forgotten that the United States by its own action, has debarred itself from the two greatest conference olaces in the world, i.e. , the assembly and the Council. I had no hesitation in presenting this viewpoint as supporting from the exactly opposite side the viewpoint above. At the present moment, to put m concisely, so long as the United -States cannot appear in
the Assembly ana Council of the League, even when its interests are vitally involved, it is not free internationally. no nation can nave complete .Liberty in ti.-^ international domain so long as it has debarred itself irom the two most important international gathering places.
4
This view, I found, was somewhat of a shook to people in Washington; they are, however, coming to realise that the Assembly and the Council, in handling questions of disarmament, the World Court, international law, etc., etc., are handling matters of considerable importance to the United States, and that it may not always be safe to be absent.
Disarmament:	The most immediate phase of American
co-operation in League work hem I was in Washington, was necesssrily disarmament, which was then in full swing in Geneva. There can be no doubt that the oresent Administration is utterly opposed to wasting money on battleships and is anxious for a large reduction in expenditure both as an essential factor in world peace and as providing funds for far more productive social activities. Mr. Hoover is an engineer who cares more for social progress and the abolition of poverty than he does for engines of world destructiveness. He can undoubtedly carry the country with him in this viewpoint if the other nations will give him what appears to his people as a fair and reasonable agreement. Those with whom I talked seemed greatly gratified by the declarations before the Preparatory Commission; they were very eager to know details and admitted they had not a very clear idea of what had actually taken place. If disarmament turns out well, Mr. Hoover's international policies will be greatly strengthened and we may hope for an improvement all along the line; if disarmament turns out ill, there will undoubtedly be a tightening up towards further American isolation.
The World Court: The next most immediate and perhaps in the end even more important League question during my stay in Washington was naturally the r‘orld Court. The Administration is ready and anxious to do everything in its power to secure final acceptance of the so-called Hoot formula; indeed, had it

the big organisations to mobilise the general public situation; the Hearst Press and other Isolationists are attempting to rouse the country to the terrible dangers of the Court by r:hat I hone may be an ill-timed and misspent campaign. Several Senators agreed that the Senate struggle will be bitter, not because of the Court itself, but because the Opposition feels that American entry into the Court would constitute the first permanent organic connection with an agency of the League„
League Finances: The question of a fair ccntrioution by the United States Government towards the expenses of League work-in which it co-operates is sure to have in Washington a larger and more sympathetic study in the future than in the past, It
6
is troublesome from two viewpoints: first, that it is extremely difficult to separate the official and the unofficial cooperation, and second, that it might open the way to attacks by League enemies who through it would obviously see how far American co-operation has gone.
Treaty purchase : One derail perhaps worth mentioning was the further negotiation both with the State Department and the World Peace Foundation for the pur chase by the American Government of 40/5C complete sets of the Treaty Series from 1920 onwards, at a cost of about 07500, for the purpose of distributing to all American Embassies and Legations. This development is a very interesting one as showing the importance and utility attached to the Treaty Series by the American Government.
Public opinion and organisation: Never, I think, has
public opinion been more friendly or better informed towards
the League than now. The League of Nations Association has
been completely reorganised under the direction of kessrs.■ 'ickersham
and Fosdick; has a new director in the New York headquarters,
Mr. Nash, and active offices in Chicago, Washington and Boston;
and has decided to open an important office in Geneva. The
World Peace Foundation is most encouragingly developing its
campaign on a 075,000 budget for the increased sale of League
constantly enlarging
publications. The Foreign Policy Association is/its study of League work, and other great associations for iniorming public opinion are finding it increasingly necessary tq/concentrate on League activities. The Rockefeller groups are finding more and more in the League to interest them; iMe Carnegie endowment has recently done one or two things in connection vita League

international work:
deal of tine was required on this last trip for the consideration of various financial grants, as folio?; s:
1. The library Endowment. On the basis of a memorandum Brora the Secretary-General containing a detailed plan by Dr. Sevensma, Mr. Rockefeller agreed to advance at once pSOO.OGO of the Library endowment in order that certain essential work should begin immediately, even before the Library itself was ready. The cheque has not been received; it will allow an increased Library revenue of some 150,000 francs a year; it should also require some study as regards investment and management.
2. The League buildings. Mr. Rockefeller also agreed that 0100,000 of his gift for Library construction might be devoted to the grading of the Ariana property.
2>. The League Ts Health work, While I was in Mew York also, though I had nothing to do with it, the International Health Board voted 0144,000 a year for the next five years to the League’s health work. A part of this is ear-marked

5.	Economic Abstracts. There seems very good reason to hope that a mutually helpful merger may be effected betv.ee the proposal made some tine ago by the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation for a compilation of all current economic abstracts and a similar but very much wider syste of abstracts of all the social sciences just launched in the United States. Dr. Bowman, who came to Paris to a League committee in March where a general agreement was secured, has had good success in carrying out the programme in Hew York; there is every possibility that if Trench and German interests can find a certain amount of money for their end of it, the Americans will be able to find a similar amount for the very appreciable additional expenses that would be incurred by them. If success is achieved; I hope we may have a formal note of confirmation through the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation and a mention of the Committee's collaboration on the title-page of the periodical publication.
6.	International Co-ooeration Fund. On the steamer going back, Mr. Forstall and I vent into very great detail as tc the possibility of his organising an international cooperation fund to be equipped with a considerable amount
9
of money for the extension of various international interests, both official and unofficial, along the lines of the memorandum which I drew up for him. Pending completion of the details, Mr. Porstall has agreed to help finance the Geneva office of the League of Nations Association; offered 05000 for a revolving fund for the extension of Information Section publications; agreed to a small expenditure for research and preparation in connection with the Committee on International Aerial Organisation; and given two cheques, one for certain special publications and the other for social betterment in Geneva. As regards the higger question, both Mr. Porstall and Mr. Arthur Bullard have agreed that the latter should spend July and August in Geneva making an intensive study, first as to the general principles and organisation of such a fund, and second, as to the specific contributions suggested in my memorandum for study.

NOTE BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL.
THE DISADVANTAGES OF HOLDING LEAGUE MEETINGS OUTSIDE GENEVA.
The attached letter, dated November 29th, from the Resident Delegate of the International Association of Journalists accredited to the League, with my reply, is circulated to Under Secretaries General, Directors and Chiefs of Services for information and for any necessary action in accordance with the last paragraph of my reply.

Genève, le 29 novembre 1929.
A son Excellence Sir Eric Iruramond
Secrétaire général de la Société les Nations.
Lrxylijjj.
Cher Sir Eric,
Les soussignés sont désireux d'attirer toute votre bienveillante attention personnelle sur un problème qui les préoccupe beaucoup et qui, de leur avis, a une influence indéniable sur une
I
bonne marche des travaux de la Société des Nations.
Le Conseil de la Société des Nations* l’Assemblée et le Secrétariat général lui-meme ont souvent souligné l’intérêt que représente pour l’oeuvre de Genève, la présence, au siègô de la Société des Nations, d'une équipa de journalistes spécialisés dans. les travaux si complexes de la Société. La tâche de la Société augmentant chaque année, l’opinion publique s’orientant de plus en plus vers les méthodes inaugurées à Genève, on pouvait penser que cette équipe de journalistes de la première heure allait, elle aussi, .s’augmenter d’unités nouvelles. Or, c'est tout le contraire qui se produit.
Non seulement il ne vient plus de nouveaux journalistes s’installer auprès de la Société des Nations mais il en part beaucoup et plusieurs de ceux qui représentent ici de grands journaux ou de puissantes agences en sont à se asmander s’ils pourront, longtemps encore, justifier leur présence à Genève. Ce fait peut paraître paradoxal et cependant, cher Sir Eric, nous sommes à votre disposition pour vous cémenter que t6l grand journal a retiré son correspondant sans songer à le remplacer, que telle agence se tâte, que plusieurs journalistes attachés à différents journaux de moindre importance sont partis pour des rives plus laborieuses parce qu'ils ne trouvaient plus ici matière à travailler sérieusement. Le ceux qui restent plusieurs songent finalement à
- 2 -
habiter Berne eu Zurich, villes plus centrales pour observer es qui se passe, par exemple, on Suisse, en Italie ou en Autriche; d’autres enfin ne voient pas sans ennui leur activité se reluire à rien pendant de longs mois. Sans aucune exagération nous croyons devoir vous informer qu’il s’agit bel et bien ¿’une sorte de dissolution générale de 1’équipe ¿es journalistes spécialisés. A qui, en effet, est-il permis de chômer penaent de longues semaines, des mois mûme, ainsi que la plupart des
soussignés	le font	ma	intonant.			
Si	, comme	on	1'annonçait ce	matin meme , la	m r> oc	ème
session du	Conseil	de	la Société des	Hâtions devait	SQ	tenir
à Londres, nous serions restés à Genève inactifs de septembre 1929 à Mai 1950.
Cette situation n’est plus tenable.
S’il s’agissait encore d’une sorte d’arret dans les travaux de la Société des lotions! Mais il n’en est rien. Pour s’en convaincre il suffit de consulter la dernière liste des réunions convoquées sous les auspices de la Société.
Si le s journaliste s accrédités auprès de la Société des lotions chôment, la Société, elle, se trouve fort active, mais en dehors de son siège normal. Or, nous savons, mieux que personne, qu’à ce système la Société ne trouve que désavantages : conditions de travail souvent déplorables, dépenses injustifiables, et surtout formidable déficit
dans sa publicité quotidienne.
Est-il possible de porter remède à cette situation?
Le mal existe et il a débuté par les sessions déambulatoires du Conseil à travers l’Europe. L’excuse du climat ne tient pas debout; nous avons à Genève, comme l’an dernier d’ailleurs, une fin d'année remarquable et les journalistes qui, depuis
5
ses débuts, assistent la Société des Bâtions se souviennent qu’en décembre 1S25, opium, en beaucoup d'autres circonstances aussi, les Conférences se sont séparées à No£l pour reprendre, avec plus d'ardeur en Janvier. N'y a-t-il pas quelque chose de singulier dans le fait que l'on engage de fortes dépenses pour la construction du nouveau Palais de la Société alors que, lentement nais sûrement, s'impose un système, car système il y a, tendant à écarter de Genève une partie de l'activité de la Société des Bâtions.
les soussignés, enfin, se plaçant à un point de vue qui doit être aussi celui de la Société des Estions ont vivement regretté la suppression d'une des quatre sessions annuelles du Conseil. Si, sur les trois sessions restantes, une se tient encore ailleurs qu'à Genève, vous verrez beaucoup d'entre nous plier bagages et l'équipe des journalistes spécialisés dans les travaux de la Société des Bâtions ne sera bientôt plus qu'un .souvenir.
C'est sur cette situation grave que nous avons voulu attirer votre attention, l'opinion publique est le meilleur moyen d'action de la Société des Bâtions. Cette opinion publique est faite en grande partis par les journalistes établis à Genève. On compromettrait certainement une part du succès de l'oeuvre accomplie ici si, par des décisions successives, on provoquait la désagrégation du groupe de publicistes qui, depuis dix ans, ont fait des travaux de la Société des Bâtions, leur spécialité.
Veuillez agréer,, cher Sir Eric, l'expression de notre haute considération.

¡NEVA,
December 9th,
1929.
Dear Monsieur Laya,
On November 29th you sent me a letter bearing the signature of thirty of your colleagues, regarding the disadvantages which result from holding League meetings outside Geneva. I have also received a letter dated December 3rd in which two more journalists associate themselves with the terms of your letter.
In view of the great services rendered to the League by the journalists stationed in Geneva, I naturally could not fail to give your letter the most careful consideration.
You will realise that decisions to hold meetings away from Geneva have usually been taken by a majority vote after discussion in which opposition to such a step was by no means wanting, and that it is not in the power of the Secretariat to prevent a recurrence of such decisions. Nevertheless, I beg to assure you that I attach much importance to your arguments, and that when in future the question arises of holding a League meeting away from Geneva, the reasons which you bring forward in your letter will add their weight to the opinions expressed more than once by the Assembly itself.
Believe me, dear Monsieur Laya, Yours sincerely, (signed) Eric DRUMMOND,
Monsieur F. LAYA,
Dêlégué-Résident de l’Association Internationale des Journalistes
accrédités auprès de la Société des Nations, 4, Boulevard du Theatre

S.GTJE OF
NÆ IONS,
Circulate to
ÎJnder Secretaries General and Directors,
Confidential Circular 12.1929. Geneva, 21st December, 1929.
HOLDING OH LEAGUE CONFERENCES OUTSIDE GENEVA,
I think this memorandum by Sir A. Salter is of great interest.
( Intlido) E .D.	, /o
20/12/¿9
Paris, December 19 29..
SE CRETAN Y-GEiTERAL.
1.	I think I ought to send you a memorandum on the practical experience of holding two conferences (the Treatment of Foreigners and the Abolition of Prohibitions) outside Geneva. These two Conferences involved both difficult questions of policy and very complex and technical detail.
My remarks apply with special force to Conferences of 1thIs kind. They would not have the same force as regards meetings of purely technical committees, not requiring negotiations on difficult questions of policy (e.g. the Financial Committee giving expert advice on a single country’s problem), nor as regards political conferences desiring to secure agreement on a few major principles of policy not involved in complex detail.
2,	The two Conferences together continued for a total of 7 weeks, often needing after-dinner work; over 100 people
we re invo1ved.
The provision of acoommodstion under these conditions must have involved a serious strain on the hospitality offered by the French Government, and upon the
Tm q4~
rut Océanographique whose premises were provided,
Every possible arrangement was made by the French Government {special telephones being for example installed, and the normal meetings and courses of the Institute being entirely subordinated to our needs},. We ought certainly to feel a certain apologetic gratitude, especially as the meeting
in Paris was	not asked for by France	or	for
rz J4-O o -i- u	is not, however, surpris!	ng that	
every effort	the material conveniences	of	tlie
was necessari	ly very inferior to those	of	G øh
The Institute is nearly y hour taxi-drive from the League Office, and almost as far from the hotels in which most of the Delegates were staying.
This involved, for those who had to attend two meetings in a day (and some had to attend three) about labour s in taxisa Apart from the waste of time involved this had an effect on the "nerves” of the Conference which can easily be understood.
The main Conference hall, in the form of a lecture theatre, tended to make every observation take the character of a formal speech and discouraged close debate and interchange of views» Occasionally a useful sub-committee could not be held for want of room»
4» A considerable number of Delegates having other work in Paris naturally did not turn it over to other people as they would have if they had come to Geneva,
Attendance was therefore irregular and could never be
relied on
This naturally applied most to some of the ablest Delegates who were appointed as Chairmen of Commissions and Rapporteurs, whose absence was often destructive of regular work*
The distance involved — and to some extent the attractions of Paris - made the informal evening discussions, on which the success of a difficult Conference often depends, impracticable„ From the moment the Delegates left the Conference room they were out of reach - and also out of the atmosphere of the Conference and its work; whereas at Geneva, with conversations at hotels, and in walking to and from them, and with improvised consultations practically all waking time and all thought is concentrated on one task.
The material difficulties of the Secretariat were enormous. There were times, for example, when a draft- written after 11 p.iru had to be distributed over the hotels of a great capital the same evening. Also there could be no elasticity in the personnel arrangements. While we necessarily had to bring more people than were required on the days of least activity (the excess in that case being on these days wasted instead of doing other ?/ork as they would at Geneva), there were times when the strain was impossible and when committees had to be suspended or abandoned for want of staff.
The reaction on the other work of the Section was necessarily serious. In effect the whole centre of our worm was moved from Geneva to Paris for nearly two nontns, I ..as in Paris myself for example not mainly to handle the Conferences' work (for which M. Stoppani was directly responsible) but
-4-
because the great majority of the people with whom I had to deal on other matters (both Secretariat and Delegates) were in Paris (Tariff Truce, Agriculture, coal etc, etc.); and I had thus, at great inconvenience, to deal from Paris with all other work (Financial Questions, etc...).
5.	It is difficult to estimate the exact importance of the varying adverse factors when a Conference has failed. But I think we should certainly have made a substantial progress, of real value, at Geneva which we did not achieve at Paris, with the Treatment of Foreigners Convention;
and some well qualified to judge (though I do not myself share this opinion) believe that we should have successfully concluded the Convention,
6.	I need not enlarge on the expense, as this is the one factor (and far from the most important) which is capable of expression in a definite figure and is clearly-realised by Council and Assembly .
