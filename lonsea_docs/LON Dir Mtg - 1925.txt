1* Tho SECRD IlRY-GSIiER/il -Wo 1 coined II. C a tact ini on tho first occasion on which ho had attended a Direct ors1 mooting as a regular member.
2.	The SECI.BTARY-GEIFiRAL said that the Agenda for tho narfb Council session would presumably include one item placed on
it by tho President, namely, that of the Gorman Rote requesting elucidations concerning certain articles of tho Covonant. The Council might doc id o to deal with the- matter under the Article empowering it to deal with any question arising under tho Covenant. It might defer tho whole matter to tho Assembly,if any question of spocial concessions rendered this course advisable. It might also decide to send a note to the Gorman Government explaining what would bo the German position if Germany entered the League and trying to calm tho German fears.
3.	The SECRET JR Y-GEmX AL then referred to a letter received
from tho Conference of Ambassadors stating that tho Inter-Allied
Naval Coraraission of Control in Germany had nov; toon wound up. Tho duties confer rod upon tho Council under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles therefore became operative and in the event of a Government applying to tho Council for an investigation in Germany in this connection, the Council would have to decide "by a majority whether such investigation wore necessary or no.
4.	The SMCIiE Murf-GIfEMAL then alluded to the dispute which had arisen at Danzig o on corning tho pillar hones which had suddenly boon put up in that city with announce merits that they woro for the Polish post only. The Danzig Senate considered this an infraction of tho High Commissioner1s decision., Tho mattor was now under considjration and it was to bo hoped that a settlement would bo reached*
Dr. ILiJCIIlOi y while unable to empress an opinion upon tho merits of tho dispute, thought the incident somewhat more complex. Thotn wore in point of fact two incidents, the first of which had nov; been liquidated, while tho second was duo to tho intervention of the High Commissioner and involved a discussion of tho latter's competence.
Tho SBCKETARY-GHEf: AI> said that, as the facts of tho case had not boon notified to him, it was impossible to form an opinion, Tho Polish representative vms to see him that afternoon and would discuss tho matter.
5.	Tho 3DCIJ1 l.AY-GDlHnAL informed the mooting that Lord Cecil of Cholwood would r place Lord Salisbury as first British delegate to the Second Opium Conf oronco ,
6.	The SDCIETAIiV-GjdMnWi.L noxt referred to Major Burton’s Special Circular lTo.48, 1924, and 11. Cobban18 Minute on tho
same subject. The advantages to bo derived from Major Buxton’s urooosal soomod to affoct more especially tho press. Ee
especially tho press.
-3-
pers anally was inclined to share M. Colban’s view..
M. C0H2RT said that Major Buxton's proposal was desirable from. the Press point of view. He had discussed the matter with ?.rr. Sweet3er,. who had further suggested that the Secretary-General might make a reuort to the Council summarising the activities of the various Governments in connection with the League, for instance, ratifications of treaties, etc., in the intervals between sessions. The report would not, of course, go into detail, but it would be most useful,, as there was at present no organ for informing Governments on the matters to which he had referred, except the Press.
Professor ATTOLICO considered a regular report from the Secretary-General would be extremely useful, bit it should, of course, be oonfined to bare facts. He shared M. Colben’s view that certain items had a psychological importance for the different members of the Council.. He suggested that it might be possible to group items of minor- importance under a single heading in the Agenda In this way it would be possible to publish only the main itdms of the Agenda in the Press. Unless, however, some such formula could, be found, he would prefer to retain the present system.
The S3CRRTARY-GRN2RAL observed that only two of the items proposed by Major Buxton for inclusion in the Secretary-General's report were recurrent.. He was inclined to think, that the > Council might be suspicious of any innovation in its Agenda.
Ur. RAJCHMAN suggested that the minor items might be grouped under a heading to be entitled "Financial and. Internal
Administrative Questions". There would, of course, be a fuj.1 "list
\ *
of all such questions.
Ur. VAN HAM2L presumed that in that event there would bo an
official report on each item. He then read out Rule 3 of t3ae
* - »
Council's Rules of Procedure prescribing that the Secretary-f-General
-4-
should submit a report at the beginning of each session. Ho was in favour of M* ComerVs proposal and hoped that it might develop into a standing custom. He proposed that a specimen report should "be drawn up;
The SECEH^ARY-GENgR/J stated that M. Comer Vs proposal for a report on the activities of the Governments would entail a new obligation for the Secretariat and much hard work. It was also open to the objection that some Governments might desire to have certain matters not mentioned whereas other Governments desired them to be included. An instance in point was that of the Anglo-Irish Treaty,
Professor ATTOLICO thought that the report might be in the shape of an opening speech by the President of the Council. This course would be less open to oritioism than a written statement by the Secretary-General.
After some further discussion it was decided to appoint a committee to consider M. ComerVs proposal for a regular report to the Council by the Secretary-General.
7,	The SECRETARY-GENERA! stated that he proposed to go to Finland about February 14th. As the Council would be meeting in March he hoped to go to Tendon for a few days before leaving for Finland. He desired to visit Esthonia and Latvia, but this would depend upon weather conditions.
8..	Professor ATTOLICO said that no decision had yet been taken by the Italian Government as regards a successor for M. Salandra on the Council. The Government might indeed have no intention of taking a decision at the moment. He would probably be going to Italy at an early date and hoped to be able to obtain information on the point.
9.
Professor ATTQLIOO then referred to the question of accomodation in the Secretariat. It was impossible to continue in the present position and room must be found somehow* a decision was imperative, especially as Sections had been asked whether they were ready to make a saofifioo and all had refused. He had come to the conclusion on Mi * Huston’s recommendationj that some of the central servioee must be moved to the Villa. It was impossible to move the Distribution Branch and he had reluctantly decidod to transfer the Registry, Phis would involve the doubling of the present number of messengers.' It would probably bo necessary to remove the translation Sootign also« ' He did not think it possible too move the library, as there was no accomodation for it in the Villa. ..
M. ELoAS enquired what would become of tha Registry when the Villa was demolished to make place for the now Conference Hall*
The SECREaLiRY««(iBHE5iiiI replied that this eventuality was somewhat distant. -The Jury of Architects which was at present in session had come to two conclusions; (l) it was doubtful whether the proposed site was suitable or large enough for the kind of lgall whioh it was intended to build and (S') they had estimated that the oosts of construction would be considerably higher than had been allowed for in the- Secretariat estimates,. The whole question would probably have to bo submitted to the next Assembly.
10. .Dr. VAR HAMEL stated that he had received a telegram from Mr. Hebor Smith saying that 8,500 dollars would be guaranteed to the League for its publication concerning Legal Aid to the Poor.
11« M. LEON-IUFOUR said that M„ Borel, arbitrator in the quostion of the Ottoman Publio Debt, had visited the Secretariat and would bagin work in London on January 20th.
The Financial Committee would meet on February 6th and the Committee of Experts on Double taxation on the End.
-6
12.	Dr. RuJCHMuH said that Dr. Soman White had left the previous week for Singapore. The bureau at Singapore was of great importance a?jd would be a branch of the Health Organisation.
He had received a request from the Turkish Government asking that an expert might be sent to Turkey to study-malaria on the spot. This question would be placed on the agenda of the Malaria Commission vfe ioh was to meet on March 16th.
The Latin-nmerican Interchange of Health Personnel ryould meet at Cuba on Mareh 1st and the British Interchange on February 9th in London.
13.	M. HAAS stated that the Committee of Jurists appointed to investigate the question of the Polish Railway Direction in Danzig had now been constituted. The manbers were:
M. Vivanti, M. van Eysinga and M. Eiquille, Director of the Swiss Federal Railways. The Committee would meet on February 18th and he believed that it would find its task a simple one.
He then referred to e recent meeting of the- International Commission on Long-distance Telephony. The officials of this Ooipmission had suggested that the League should make certain, experiments which might be found to be of great utility.
For instance, it might be found possible for simultaneous communications t o be held between the Secretary-General and tho different members of the Council. It might even be
-7-
possible te Volet a sors ic n cf tho Council "by wireless without requiring the member's actually to moot or leave their homos,,
Ee hoped that the experiment might bo tried, but tho details of tho scheme would not bo definitely worked out before November or Do comber «
14.	M. QPRESCTJ said that as the French Senate had not ratified the law concerning the now Institute of Intellectual Co-operation, the French Government had -asked the Committee to postpone the discussion of tho statutes of the Institute,
The Chamber of Deputies had ratified the law.-
15.	Captain MATES IIS T said that tho P.A.-C. would moot on February 5th to consider the best means of organising any possible investigation regarding the demilitarisation of the Rhineland. The Co-ordination Commission would meet on February loth. The Italian representative would be Count Bonin-Longero. Ee had not yet received the name of tho British of Belgian representative.
Tho SECRET ARY- GENERAL said that he would bear tho matter in mind.
16.	Dame Rachel CROWD Y asked if it Would be possible for Directors to get into touch With tho delegates from their
own countries during the resumed meetings of tho Opium Conference. It was most desirable that a general policy should be adopted-.
Professor ATTCLICO .and Dr. VAN EAEEL agreed that Dame Rachel Cxowdy's suggestion was a most desirable one and requested that she would give them all available information on the point.
M. DÉNIS had received no information regarding the
French delegate.
-8-
17.	Mr. BUSIES stated that the Supervisory Commission would moot the following wool:.
Tho accounts for 1924 had. Icon closed on December 31st, Thoro was a smaller margin than in previous years except in the C'-se of the Technical Org-’nis at ions-whose tuidgets showed considerable surpluses. The surplus this year amounted to about 2 or 3 million francs.
18.	Mr. BI2L3R said that the appointment of Dr. Riddell as Permanent Advisory Officer for the Dominion of Canada had given rise to some discussion in the "How Ycrl Herald" and tho Canadian Press.

1,	The meeting discussed and approved the provisional draft Agenda for the forthcoming March session of the Council subject to certain modifications. It was decided to adhere to the form of agenda without cross headings in use hitherto.
An explanatory note would be issued by the Information Section to the Press as heretofore.
2.	The S3 CHE T AR Y-GE HERA L said that it was his personal opinion that there was practically no livelihood of the British Government being in a position to make a definite announcement at the March session with regard to the Protocol for the settlement of international disputes, which was still under consideration. The Dominions had rejected the Government’s invitation to an imperial conference and would be consulted by
correspondence. It Has clear from the discussions to which the Protocol had. given rise in Greet- Britain that the host course to follow far thoso who desired to secure the adoption of the Protocol in some form or other would be to refrain from attempting to force the British Government to give a definite decision at the present time. If they were asked to make a pronouncement in March they would probably be obliged to reject the Protocol. The Secretary-General hoped that, given time, the Protocol would be adopted in its ms in lines. There would, of course.., be a fresh discussion at the next Assembly. It was perhaps impossible to expect more at the moment. Modifications could best be considered by the assembly itself and it was those circles in iSz^lend who were most antagonistic to the Protocol who were pressing for a decision in March.
H. MMD-JII^G^ stated that 1!. Veverka had told him that morning that Dr. Benos felt that June would be the dangerous moment for the Protocol. The Council should certainly make some pronouncement in March.
Sir Arthur SAIT33 laid great stress on the importance of a discussion at the March session of the Council. It was desirable that the British representative should make a statement explaining the reasons why his Government was asking for time. The other representatives might welcome his statement and make e declaration to the effect that it w^s of the utmost importance that the problem of security should be discussed at the next Assembly and that it must be treated through the Lesgue.- This course would give the British Government time and would discount the disappointment which would be sure to result if there were no discussion in March. If the question were merely postponed till June, public opinion would be led to presume that the Protocol was to bo indefinitely shelved. The course he proposed would also diminish the danger of discussions outside the organs of the League.
The matter also affected the possibility of Germany entering the league. If she realised that there were to he a discussion of p^ramount importance on security next September, Germany would understand that it wps her interest to apply for admission,
M. MAIÍT0UX and I7. 30IJIT3T thought that there would be no opposition to this course from the French Government.
The SECXDT.ñíY-GniJER^L thought it would be diflicult to obtian a definite statement from the Eritish Government agreeing that the problem of security must be dealt with through the League They wore likely on the other hand to be ready to discuss the Protocol at the next ..soom'bly.
With regard to the question of the right of investigation under the Treaties of Peace, Er, van HALIL L stated that under the Treaty of Versailles the Council had no special powers to talco action upon reports from the Commissions of Investigation. This viow had indeed been expressed by II. Uhden, Swedish representative at the thirty-second session of the Council,
40 Sir Arthur SALTEE said that the Economic Committee had under consideration a proposal that at its next mooting other countries should be represented on the Committee,
He then referred to the severe economic crisis in Austria. This might partly be ascribed to some of the measures taken by the late Government of Hr, Soipel, who had loyally observed the Austrian Government’s engagements to tho League, The present Government was by no means sc energetic.
5c With reference to the question of tho appointment of the members of the Saar Governing Commission, the SECHETARY-GEFERAL thought it probable that the present members of
"4—
the CQnmiission viould be re-appointed for another year. It would Ido letter to leave M_. Hault in the Chair for the coming' yator , bu b in order to 3 cu nr erect any unfortunate effects which this decision might have it would he desirable to arrange if possible that after the year the Presidency should be held by rotation* hn informal arrangement had been more oy less acoeptad at the beginning of the Leagues existence that the Chair should bo held for the first fivo years by a Frenchman, for the next five years by a subject of another country and for the last fivo years by a Sarrois,	In the present circumstances
however, it would probably be bettor that the; Chair should change hands regularly,
Ms HOSTING- said that nc action could ho taken with regard to the Saar Local Gendarmerie pending the receipt of the budget*
6. In regard to the question of Danzig M, HOSTING said that the High Commissioner had now intimated that the Polish and Dan.zlg Governments had boon unable to agroe upon a successor to the retiring Chairman of the Harbour Board, It would therefore bo necessary fer the Council to appoint a Bwriss citizon,
dir Arthur SALTER said that the question of a loan to bo issued by the City of Danzig would bo considered by the Financial Committees and if the latter reported favourably, v/ould be submitted to the Council,
7* Referring to the rejection by the G-eeek Parliament of the Protocol concerning Bulgarian minorities in C-rcece, the SECRETARY GEEBHAL said that the Council had no power to impose tho Protocol on Greece, As tho Bulgarian Government had submitted the Bulgarian Protocol for ratification by Parliament,
-5-
the Greek Government was entitled to take the same course.
If, for any boason, it appeared that the minorities in Greece wore not receiving proper treatment the Council had. hlways tho power to send out a Commissioner to conduct investigations on the spot.
8.	II. i/UNTOUi referred to tho petition submitted to the Council by tho late Albanian Government. ri'he new Government had not yet sent in a formal request for the withdrawal of the requestj which was therefore technically still on the Councils agenda.
It was agreed 'that II. liantoux should consult M. Blinishti personally on the matter.
9.	The SECRETARY GENERAL next referred to the German Rote regarding the possible admission of Germany to tho league.
Ho drew attention tc the papers received from Dr. van Hamel and M, Mantoux and summarised the different proposals made by thorn as regards the bo^t course to follow in tho matter,
■ - Professor nTTGLICO said that, of course, the Council would eventually bring the mttor before the assembly. The Council must, however, send a lettor to tho German Government informing them that action was being taken in the matter, and this letter might bo so framed as to oblige tho German Government to send an answer in less ambiguous terms than those of tho Note of December 12th. Germany should bo placod in the position of being obliged to send a more definite answer to the assembly.
Sir Arthur SALTER agreed in the main with Professor iittolico, un immediate reply, however short, was essential and should contain some reference to the quostion raised in tho Note, whether Germany as a Member of tho League would bo able
-6-
to preserve her neutrality in the event of war. Prima facie he thought the letter had probably beon drafted by persons who were not in favour of Germany's entry, but who felt obliged to take account of the largo body of opinion in Germany in favour of the League and of Germany's participation. Tho Council's letter might bo drafted on the following lines: They would acknowledge tho letter and say that it must be sont to the -Assembly; in the ire antimo they might point out that the remission of obligations sufficient to ensure Germany's noutrality in time of wax would on the face of it bo incompatible with the Covenant and with Gormany's own interests.
The SECRETARY GEHEEnl was not in favour of M, Mantoux's proposal for referring tho matter to a rapportour, since the latter, being a member of a Government, would bo placed in a very awkward position. Ho wondered whether it was advisable for the Council to say in its letter that the matter would bo referred to the assembly. If it did so, Germany would bo able to say that she would postpone any application for admission as tho assembly was to deal with the matter. He would suggest that the Counoil's letter should embody Sir .Arthur Salter's and Hr. van Hamel's suggestions and should include a statement that the correspondence was being forwarded to all the Members of the league. While fully agreeing with Hrt van Hamel's proposal he thought that greater emphasis should be laid on tho point concerning tho advantages which Germany would reap by being inside tho League.
Professor aTTOLICO thought that if the Counoil refused to assume responsibility in tho mat tor, an interim answer at any rate was indispensable.
-7
l'ho SECRETARY GENERAL pointed out that the Council was not empowered to make concessions, hut was merely entitled to draw Germany's attention to oortain facts and points of view.
M. BONNET thought that there was some danger in entering into details. The letter should ho so framed as to include a sort of invitation tc the German Government to discus.s the- legal points at the .assembly.
The SECRETARY GENERAL remarked that it would he useless to send a collective answor from the Council unless it contained something more than the letters from
the separate Governments to the German Government.
Thore' would of course he no discussion of legal points, tho letter being confined to stating certain broad political considerations with a view to enlightening Gorman opinion,
10.	The SECREILiRY GENERAL said that no official
communication had yet boon received concerning the oompulsory exchange of tho Oocumonical Patriarch. They might, however, expect to recoivo a request from the Greek Government under tho terms of Article II of the Covenant. Ho hoped that
tho situation would mako it possible to wait till tho March session of the Council; otherwise it would bo nooossary to hold an extraordinary session» Ho trusted that tho matter would come before tho Eoaguo, as it had greatly excited public opinion in all countries. He did not think that the Turkish Government would refuse to appear before the Counoil, and thoy would probably be ready to appear
/before the Court of International
-8-
Justice, should the Council decide to ask the Court's opinion on the question of domestic jurisdiction. He considered that in view of the provisions of the Covenant the Greek Government could hardly go to war without first appearing "before the Council.
11,	The SSCR3TA3Y-G3NER/ili then referred to the Turkish complaint concerning the treatment "by the British authorities of two Turkish interpreters attached to the Turkish assessor on the Irak Commission. After explaining the situation he stated that the Turkish papers had published the original telegram from the Ottoman Government on the subject. The correspondence would not be issued to the Members of the League before the following evening, but, as the British telegram had not yet been published in any paper, he proposed that the whole correspondence should be issued to the Pres3 that night,
12.	The 3;]CRBTAnY-GH’TBHAIi next referred to the application made by the International Federation of Trade Unions for representation on the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in 7omen and the Protection of Children, There was more than one course to be followed in the matter. Dame Rachel Crowdy might write to the Federation and suggest that they should send an application to himself, which, in that case, would be placed on the Council's Agenda among the communications from non-official "international associations. The matter could then be raised by any Member of the Council who desired to do so. The Federation would not probably have much difficulty in finding a Member who would be prepared to raise the question. Alternatively, he could send the application to the Committee itself for an opinion, Again the application could be referred to the International Labour Office, who might not unreasonably reply that it wa3 for their Organisation to represent all labour interests on the Comm.itteeV In any case he thought it would be wise to consult the International Labour Office concerninn the Federation,
-9-
Ee understood that twojother applications for adir.ission had heen received from associations representing the interests of women.
Dr. van HAMEL thought it unwise to consult the Committee on a question of its own composition» He thought it best to consult the Labour Office as tiiefe was some risk of the Secretariat receiving revests frohi all sorts of Labour organisations if it accepted in this particular instance*
Sir Arthur SALTER considered that the League13 expert adviser in labour questions should invariably b,e the International Labour Office.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL intimated that the Labour Office would be consulted privately.
13.	The SECRETARY GENERAL stated that there had recently been a very serious increase in the volume of work sent to the Translation Section. He had received a letter from, the Head of the English Translation Section stating that in his opinion many of the\ bulky documents sent for translation by various sections, more particularly the Econom.io, the Transit, the Health and the Mandates Sections could be summarised and that in some cases translation was quite unnecessary. The question of the Reform of the Calendar, for instance, was sometimes dealt with in documents of immense length which could easily he summarised, Unless Sections would consent to summaries, it would be necessary to increase the Translation Section, and he appealed to all Directors to exercise strict supervision,
After further discussion, it was agreed that the matter should be referred to a Committee consisting of Professor ¿ittolico, the heads of the technical sections most vitally concerned, Major Buxton, Captain Dennis and 11. Demolon,.

London was to ascertain the vie-vs of the British Government on the agenda of the forthcoming session of the Council. He had found the Protocol the subject of eager discussion, but these discussions had not reached a sufficiently advanced stage to allow him to do anything more than explain various points of vie--". At the time of his visit the Protocol had not been discussed either by the Cabinet or by the Committee of Imperial Defence, and was still under consideration by a sub-committoe of the latter. The position might perhaps become clearer after the debate in the House of Commons that day and after the discussion by the Council at its next session. In his avn opinion the British Government had not yet come to a definite decision, and the best course would be to try to obtain the adjournment of the -hole question until the next Assembly. The position v/as' ospecially involved o^ing te the present state of the question of security. The question could
hardly^be-sa-parated from that of the evacuation of Colog:—
In certain circles there was a strong feeling against the Protocol which extended to Article 16 of the Covenant. If certain parts of the Protocol had to be dropped care must be taken that this did not involve any impairment of the Covenant.	1
Sir Herbert AMES referred to a lea'ing article in the last number of the ’’Round Table” containing a strong attack on the Covenant as a whole.
The SECEHTARY-GEIT1EAL said that at Stockholm he was unfortunately unable to see Hr. Branting, who was then already seriously ill. Li. Unden had told him that he -was doubtful whether he could himself come to the Council Session as an important discussion in Parliament on the Swedish .armaments was anticipated during the week of the Council's session.^. He had written to Unden, urging him to come to Geneva if possible.
M. C0L3AN stated that a telegram had been received from the Swedish Foreign Ministry to the effect that 1.1. Unden would represent Sweden if it were possible, but that otherwise he would be replaced by M. Sjoborg,
The SECRETARY-GHII'.RAL said that he had had a very warm reception in Finland, The position'of that country was especially interesting, situated as it was midway between the Scandinavian and the Baltic groups. The general trend, of Finnish opinion was that it would be prudent not to join either group, but to act as a benevolent neighbour and s-ounneot-ing link between the two groups. He was under the.Impression that there was not much fear in Finland of Russia, even supposing the latter country made an attack on the Baltic States.
The Finns were proud of their army, and believed that their defences were strong. He hoped that a Finnish architect whose work had much impres.a.e_d__.hf.• would compete for the building jj-p
-3-
the-league Conference Hall.
•The next' ccuntryvisi ted was Ltethonia. The "Secretary—General thought that the attempted Bolshevik Revolution of last December, so far from damaging the country, had one much good. It had opened the eyes of the Rethonians to the danger of Bolshevism, and had aroused patriotism in all classes. He had been particularly impressed by a parade hold on Bsthonia's Independence Day, in which not only the armed forces of the State but civilian organi sat ions of all kinds had taken part. The system of land reform was, ho thought, excellent, and most of the peasants had now become landowners. It was indeed extraordinary that Bsthonia had succeeded in building up this position without external aid. The Government was on close terms with the Latvian Government, and was now making arrangements for the economic entente between the two countries.
He did not know the position with regard to a military treaty, but the General Staffs of the two countries were probably in clbso touch with one another.
The position in Latvia was slightly different. As there had been no Bolshevik attempt in that country, the Latvian Government had concentrated on the economic rather than on the.military situation. He did not think that there could he much to fear from a possible Russian invasion, as Latvia and Bsthonia between them could put about 700,000 men into the field, and it was held that an army of something like five times this sice would be required to conquer the two countries. However, talk of the Russian danger was so general in Latvia that it might have the consequence of frightening foreign capital from the country. 3oth countries showed the utmost attachment to the League, and would work for the enhancement of its prestige and the strengthening of its position.
’"Tien at Riga the Secretary-General had been pressed by the Lithuanian Government to stay two or trree days at Kovnc. His arrangements, which provided only for a few hours at Zcvno, made this impossible, and he thought that a long stay
-4-
might have given rise to difficulties. The Lithuanian
Government, however, had given them an extremely warm
reoeptioxia, and he would like to add that now that he had
seen Kovno he personally understood the desire of the
Idthu.' nian Government to return to Vilna from an official and
residential point of view. The Lithuanian President had made
a reference to Vilna in his speech, stating that he hoped to be
able to welcome him, the Secretary General, on hie next visit
to Lithuania in a city more worthy of that country. Tho
Foreign Minister had me.de no reference to Vilna. The
Secretary GeneralTs personal view was that there were great
opportunities of development at Kovno. and he believed that
every effort would be made to devclfflp that city, which was an
important railway end river junction. He Made a speech which
*
was not perhaps altogether agreeable to the Lithuanian Government. He had not seen if it had been reported or commented on by the Polish press. He had been told that an economic rapprochement with Latvia and Ssthonia was in view and if so it would greatly forward Lithuanians prosperity.
This, he thought, would be the only method of inducing Lithuania ultimately to come to an arrangement with Polandw He h d reached the conclusion that the Polish view that Lithuania could be brought to capitulate if she were isolated was essentially unsound.
From Kovno tho Secretary General went to Berlin, where he had a conversation with Herr von Schubert, Under Secretary for Foreign affairs, concerning the German Memorandum on that country’s entry into tho League. The impression which he h G brought away with him from that conversation with regard to Germ nyTs difficulties concerning Article 16 of the Covenant was tin t 1) the question of Germany sending troops in aid of a Member which had been attacked was not of practical importance, 2} Germany would not be altogether unwill ing to subscribe to
-5**
the conditions concerning economic sanctions, hut that 3) the question of the passage of foreign troops through (reman territory was the crucial point, and that for two reasons» In the first place, Germany was unwilling to face the possibility of a declaimtion of war by the country against whom the troops were to be sent, . nd, secondly, the passage of French troops through Gem, ny would be cert in to give rise to all kinds of incidents and was not a practical proposition. Two further outstanding questions which until settled militated against Germ, ny °s entry into the League were those of the establishment of permanent organisation of control in the Rhineland and the problem of the Saar Territory. The Secretary General had paid what was intended to bo a short formal call on Herr Stresemann, who had immediately entered into the question of Germany?s entry and had taken up a far less compromising attitude. Herr Stresemann thought that if Germany entered the League she could only do so if she were not obliged to pledge herself to take action which would be likely to lead to a declaration of war against her by any country which defied the Covenant. If she took economic sanctions, this action would certainly lead to a declaration of war, The Secretary General had pointed out that GermanyTs position might be easier in that event if she were within the League, as there was the possibility o... supplies being rationed for those outside. His general
I
impression from this conversation was that Herr St re seme nn was not really anxious for Germany to enter the League, <_nd was not therefore inclined to m, ke things easy. Influential circles in Germany feared lest if she entered the League Germany would be treated as . n inferior, and there were a.lso apprehensions of a serious broach with Russia. Herr Stresemann had pointed out that even if she obtained the conditions which she demanded in rep rd to intiole 16 Germany, in view of the Russian attitude would be taking a certain risk in entering the League. The Secret, ry Goner:lrs view was that
-6-
Germnny foi.red to alienate Ru.sia beceuse Russia was her only support.
Thic support she would lose if she entered the league. There had
been much disappointment regarding the possibility of eaouomio open-
*
ings for German trade in Russia. The Germ, n Government also felt that it was by no means improbable that economic relations between France and Russia wore on the point of development, and that Franoe might be able to obt: in or offer better tersn than Germany. The Secretary Goner. 1 h. d jpade certain no'i es which he would probably circulate to Directors, .. nil he a sked that they might be treate . as c jnfidentiaX.
In reply to a question by M. Haas, the Secretary General said that the Lithuani. n Government had informed him that eleotions for Menel would be held in April or Mayp but certainly not later than Juno He had been unable to see the Jewish Community iit Kovno, but he was confident that the Jews in that city received favour able treatment.. The Lithuanian Government, thinking it had granted the Jews too many concessions, was now withdrawing certain privileges, but their position would, however, still remain one of exceptional favour.
M. MiNfOUX said that when in Finland he had received an application from certain refugees from Eastern Garelia, who had presented a Memorandum which would be circulated. The answer already given by the Council on this subject was the only possible reply. He had heard that the administration in Eastern Carelio had been decentralised, and that cert, in refugees had gone back to that country.
Sir Herbert .HIES st. ted that, from the financi. 1 point of view, the past year had been the most successful in the history of the League. He requested Directors to be good enought to forward to him estimates for the next year at the earliest possible date.
M. C01BAH hoped that the Representatives of members at the forthcoming Council Session would not attempt to expedite business too muoh. There was some danger of public opinion feeling that the Council had too little time to give to the consideration of important questions,
i'.l •
j£i..i3 stated that excellent relations hac subsisted
between tha members of the dec re to fcio t and the Re .presents: t ivo
of Russia at the Paris mootin' of tho dub-commit too for the
Unification of 'forma go Measurement in Inland liavigo t icn.
He had coma to tha conclusion that th© Hussion Government
mould be milling to co-operate with tho /aerateriot in this
matter, out that they liab an invincible repugnance to
attencl 1 ng aliy meeting hold in Geneva.
The oPCfuJih. .VI GJlMP-iilj considered that tha holding of
a conference elsewhere than in Geneva v/as opon to grave
objections. 3ub-committeos could, of course, meet outside \
Genova, but if they were to attend a conferencej it would be necessary to invite the Russian representatives to come to Geneva.
Sir nrthur o-iLTBR thought it inadvisable to take any steps attempting to oblige the Russian Government to send representatives to conferences held in Geneva until the cue at ion or Germany’s entry into the rec.guo had been disposed of.
Ivi. imRl stated that tho cue at ion of the Reform of the Calendar- v/as making: slow but steady progress. . t Uhe last meeting or the Committee the reprosontotives of certain Jewish religious communities had stated their objections to the -reposal for the introduction of r week with a blank day. wurtner, hr. Booth, President of the international Chamber of Commerce, and h. van Eysinga wore roposin:.: to go to Rowe to lay certain arguments before the Roly Bee.
‘■'ith regard to the Danube Commission, If. Haas said that an excellent beginning had been made with this question. Mr. Hines, the aroitrator, would arrive in Geneva between npril 7th and 14th, and his appointment had been most favourably accepted by all Btatos concerned. He thought that

Sir Arthur SniiflGh referred to the recent neotin of the financial Committee, l’he financial situation in Han;ary mas extremely satisfactory. The Reconstruction Scheme was working up to da to, and there would probably bo no deficit in the budget, in spite of the fact that the Hungarian crown, having been stabilised on the oasis of the pound sterling, had risen in gold value concurrently with the latter currency. The
Committee were now considering what advice shoul" bo given
to the Hungarian Government in regard to the salaries, of .State officials and to the disposal of any surplus.
The Austrian situation was much less satisfactory, and the meeting had been a difficult .one The trouble was partly political and partly .financial. üpstria had been unable to make a breach in the, economic barriers imposed by other countries, and her number of unemployed had risen to 200,000 Sir nrthur Saltor would attempt to get into touch with the surrounding countries with a view to obtaining more iavourablo economic treaties where those existed, and. to expediting the conclusion of such treaties where they did not exist. The Austrian. Government had opened private conversations with tins neighbouring States, and had made an offer of free trade with any country which would reciprocate.’ In particular, they had privately sounded Germany in this matter. There was no actual arrangement with that country yet, but the Government was probably attempting to force the other countries to realise
-1C-
unless they would assist her Austria would have to fall back upon Germany. Ho was of opinion that Germany offered a market for Austrian goods.
fhe Esthonian Government had asked that the Report containing advico to that Government on its banking system might bo made in a form suitable for publication.
The Committee was now in a position to float the Danzig Economic Development Loan, provided tho Council agreed thereto. The loan was for 3g million pounds, and was interesting as it was the first purely economic loan to bo floated by the League. Onco the Council had approved this sdhemo, a Trustee would bo appointed, and if the negotiations in which ho was at present engag’dd with a. view to this appointment dic> not materialise, he hopod that it might bo possible to ask tho High Commissioner to undertake this duty provisionally, the period of his trusteeship be^Lng specifically limited to sis months.
M. 80LBaM said that there ':'as no legal objection to the Hi h Commissioner becoming Trustee for the loan, but both Poland end Danzi wore a rucio us to avoid giving the High Commissioner administrative powers. There would be no difficulty if they would agree, and as the cuestión was merely a formal one he did not anticipate opposition.
Sir Arthur	i said that tho financial Committee

1-. The SECRETARY-GENXPvAL thought that the results of the last session of the Council might he regarded as satisfactory. The British Government1 s declaration concerning the Protocol had, of course, at first appeared a serious blow to the prestige of the League. Prior to the session he had. himself hoped that the British Government would, he able to postpone taking up a definite attitude towards the Protocol, hut this had become impossible owing to the developments in the general situation as regards security and other cognate questions. It must be realised, that the possibility of putting into execution Article 16 of the Covenant in its present form, would alvqy s be difficult unless the United States of America were definitely not hostile to such action.
The effects of the British declaration would, he thought, probably be lessened! by the fact that the reply to the German memorandum of December 12th amounted to a re-statement
2,
of the importance of the obligations, contained in Article 16 of the Covenant, and this re-statement had been agreed to and approved by the British representative. The reply to Gernsny might therefore in a sense even bo considered as more important than the declaration of the British Government concerning the Protocol.
One fact had been brought out clearly, namely, tint the countries most closely interested did not intend to allow Germany to enter into a limited pact unless she previously applied to the League for admission without exceptional treatment. Germany would realise that the only method by which she could obtain the reconsideration of her eastern frontiers was the application of Article 19 of the Covenant, and this was the proper conservative attitude for the League to adopt. What had at first, therefore, seemed a blow at the League' s prestige would, if the balance in gains and losses was reckoned up, bo found to be a strengthening of its position.
2. M. COLEAN raised the question of the Council holding secret sessions for the discussion of certain questions. lie himself had suggested to the Secretary-General that it would be necessary for the Council to consider certain Danzig questions in secret, as the Council was not prepared to give the necessary time to public discussions. It was obvious tint the sessions would lave to be limited to a week so long as the different countries were represented by members of* Cabinets. It would, of course, have been impossible for the Council to got through its work if all its meetings had been held in public;, and moreover it
would Invo been impossible to treat certain subjects
3
effectively if the Rapporteur had had no opportunity of consulting his colleagues in private. There could he no doubt that the results given by secret meetings had been excellent, but II. Colban had had bitter complaints from / various delegations, more especially from Dr. Jahm, who considered that it was essential for Danzig to have the support of public opinion in the treatment of the questions affecting her, The Polish Delegation, again, had raised the right of Poland to be represented in the Council under Article 4 of the Covenants The question also affected the leagued publicity and the press, He proposed that the following points should be carefully examined before the next Council session;
1)	The possibility of redistributing the work in the various Sections. He thought it useless to attempt to decentralise work during the sessions, as delegates were only prepared to discuss matters with Directors. However excellent the preparatory 'work done in the Sections, certain subjeots would have to be discussed with the Delegations and, if necessary, new points of view adopted. The work of the Secretariat should, if possible, be so reorganised chat reports should be made ready two or three weeks before each Council session, or at any rate before the members left for Geneva* The historical parts of reports and much else could be prepared well in advance.
?.) Arrangements night be made for technical committees to meet in the intervals between sessions and not concurrently with the Council, as at present. He thought that the llinori-ties Committee, for instance, might be held outside Geneva and, in the intervals between sessions. This would give
4
representatives more time for an exhaustive consideration of each problem and would enhance the Council1s sense of the importance of Minorities questions.
Hr. 3W3BT33R thought that the last session had been the worst in his experience es far as publicity was concerned, The work had , been despatched so speedily that it had been aliamst impossible to keep up with it and the Council were continually adjourning to the Secret ary-Generali's room for private meetings, Shis had given rise to much uneasiness and to the wildest rumours. He suggested that the Council might devote a whole morning or afternoon to one continuous
private meeting, instead of adjourning public meetings from time to time. „here had been 1C5 journalists attending the session, and most of them were entirely inexperienced in the ways of the League. There had been a general impression that the Council was working too fast and was not giving sufficient consideration to different questions.
Dr. van HAMEL thought it impossible to allow the interests of the press to predominate in the arrangements for the Council sessions. The public meetings, however, at the last session had been quite unimportant and States not represented on the Council had in some instances taken 1 practically no share in the discussion of questions affecting them, from the legal point of view this treatment might be regarded as hardly fair or just. The case which lie had particularly in mind was that of Toland.
Sir Herbert ¿MBS pointed out that the present practice of holding-only four, or at the outside five sessions a year tended to over-burden the Council1 s prog-ramme of work. He wondered whether it would not oe possible to hold interim meetings for questions of limited interest, such meetings to be attended by less
5
oi’1: Ox tiio .¿ocrotariat,
important represent-.tivos then cabinet ministers. All minor items could in this -/ay be discussed exhaustively.
1.1.	CO 1/8 All stated thet the Council had already considered and rejected the scheme pr oposo-.1 by ,„ir Herbert Ames.
M. MADAAIAGA laid stress on t"o mo in to.	firstly, the
holding o? secret sessions affected th and gave rise to technical difficulties in the consideration of reports. Secondly, representatives should be requested not to isolato themselves altogether from their e .ports when discussing a given question.
Professor AT'IOIICO thought that the adoption of new methods for settling disputes between Danzig and Poland would do much to lighten the Council agenda. The realities of the situation should bo faced, and he personally orcpectod the system of transacting much important business in secret session to become the general rule, as it was both expeditious and, ho thought generally speaking, beneficial to the Lea tug.
■ /ithout private mootings the last session would have lasted two woo Its.	Ho had been greatly impressed by the efficiency
with which the last sos-ion of the Council had been conducted Tlic PDC/rT/iAY-GAlhAiAL agreed in the main with 11. Colban. He pointed out that the arrangements which ho had proposed
regarding the preparation of reports, while suitable to the Minorities and Administrative Commissions jcction, was not so well adapted to other sections. M. Colban was accepted as the chief authority in questions of the daar and Danzig,
6
but in other matters rapporteurs preferred not to commit themselves to one side or the other until they had had an opportunity of conferring with their colleagues. Prima facie he thought 1,1. Colban's proposal concerning the meetings of the Minorities Committee advantageous. He pointed out that Minorities and Administrative Commissions questions had occupied about a third of the Council's agenda. Sir Herbert Ames's suggestions ho considered unworkable. Neither the Saar nor Danzig would regard docisions taken by less important representatives as authoritativo, and he did not think this orocoduro would bo very fair either to the Daar or to Danzig. He emphasised the necessity of preparing reports at the earliest possible date, but did not think the question of publicity of very great importance, in the case of certain items it was impossible to decide whether a secret meeting would be necessary or no until tho question had reached a certain stage. At itw last session the Council had dealt with only four questions at secret mootings, namely, the Gorman Note, the Riaht of Investigation, the Danzig questions and tho Saar Governing Commission nominations, tho last of which, under tho Rules of Procedure, was bound to bo considered in secret. secret sessions were a necessity in tho case of questions concernin'- which representatives held extremely diver/rent views, as it was essential that they should make an attempt to come to an agreement bofora dealing with the matter in public. It had boon proposed that certain delegations
7
might moot privately ant talk tho mat tor oror, but tho oe ore tar j- Gronoral v:c.s personally opposed to this suggest ion, as he thought it desirable that those questions should bo properly thrashed out by tho members concerned in tho presence of tho ir other colleagues. Publicity was certainly do sir a bio in the case of questions in which two Powers brought a dispute before the Council, owing to the value of tho pressure of public opinion, in securing a solution. Again, it would have boon impossible to draft the reply to Germany otherwise than in a secret session, and in the case ox Danzig Li. Colban himself had pointed out that it was essential for tho rapporteur to bo given a guiding lino before his report was made public. Tho Council acted as a kind of jury for questions affecting Danzig. He did not agree that Poland was entitled to be present at a secret session under tho terms of Article 4 of the Covenant, and ho thought it might oven be dangerous to Poland if this question were formally raised. The agenda would bo greatly lightened by the removal of questions affecting Danzig and the Minorities. The point raise- by LI. Madariaga was due to a misunderstanding and was an isolated incident. It might perhaps bo possible, in the case of Danzig to hold a mootinn early in the session, at which each side would make a statement,ahd later a secret session for tho consideration of tho report \ and decision.
M. COIjDAII was opposed to this proposal, as ho thought it essential that a re sort should be on the Council table before the representative's of the states not Members of the Council were invited to make a statement. The existence of a report tended to prevent an acrimonious debate.
8
Dr. van HAMEL ashed whether the Secretary-General was prepared to make a statement on the general political aspect following upon the last session of the Council.. He was not stating his personal views, but wished to raw attention to the d i sc us si ons in the press concerning the general attitude of the British Government towards the League. The sharpest statement of the t attitude xu s contained in an article in the "Pester Lloyd" where the writer expressed the view that Great Britain was definitely throwing over the league and returning to the pre-war system of the halt nee of power. There was a general feeling that the present British Gov rnment wts unsympathetic towards the League as regards all major general political questions. The proposals contained in the concluding portion of Iir. Chamberlain*s declaration might be hold to support this view.
Professor .PTTOLICO pointed out that the propose! s for a limited pact at present advanced by the German and British Governments were no. materially clifferentfrom the original suggestions propounded by Lord Cecil. It wjts the feeling of the Italian Foreign Office that so long as the League was not a universal body it would be unable to deal with the major ruestions.
Ia. I.hJ'TTOUX thought there was a general tendency to accept the guidance of the League in minor natters, but that all important question? were treated and would be treated for some tine to cone, by means of direct negotiations between the foreign offices.
The	-GLKEx.AL thought it natural that so long i s
the League vw s not universal, certain of the more important rues-tions should be dealt with by direct negotiations rather than through the League. He considered, however, • that this was merely Jx transitory etc te of affairs. with regard to the attitude of the British Government it u; s true that there was a snail group in the
-9
Conservative Party which was strongly isolationist and would like Great Britain to adopt towards the LG a .'0 an attitude similar to that at present held by the United States. That group, however, represented only a small minority in the Government and in the country although it was strongly backed by one of the more popular newspapers. In his view it was impossible, however, for any 3ritish Government to pursue an anti-League policy. There was, nevertheless, one danger, namely that should tho question of security remain unsolved, public opinion in Great Britain might weary of the subject and be prepared to adopt an isolationist attitude. The assertion that Great Britain desired to return to the balance of power was, in the Beoretary-General1s view, completely mistaken. The only feasible scheme for a pact of mutual guarantee in the eyes of the British public was one which embraced not merely those countries which had fought as Allies in the war, but the ox-enemy countries also, and he believed that the British Government was concentrating all its efforts on obtaining the admission of Germany jso the League.
In his declaration, Mr. Chamberlain had stated that regional pacts must be framed in the spirit of the Covenant working in close harmony with the League and under its guidance. Mr. Chamberlain had, he thought, summed up the position adequately when he said to him that the British Government preferred the Covenant to the Protocol.
The BECxiLT-iPY GilhGlUL said that he desired to discuss the 1926 budget estimates with the various sections on Monday, 'Tuesday and fednesday of the following week.
lur. iM/EBTBEil, referring to the sale of pamphlets prepared by the Information Section, said that the English editions of those pamphlets and of the Monthly jommary. were no r practically self- supporting.
M. COLfMjN said that wherever he want he found people ¿anxious to obtain copies of various pamphlets /
10
•3i.id he hoped that the Information Section would be able to supply him with copies when he needed them.
hr. RAJCHMANN said that he had now received the printed minutes of the Singapore Medical Conference. The Conference had been a complete success and had been attended by twelve countries. The Governments of Sian, the Straits Settlements and North Borneo had promised contributions to the Singapore Health Bureau.
with regard to the question of an enouiry into malaria in Greece the new President of the refugee Settlement Commission,
Mr. Howland, took a great interest in this matter and had succeeded in obtaining a half-oromise of a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The Bulgarian Gowe rrment was more active in its measures for the suppression of malaria than the Greek Government. The Bulgarian Government had undertaken certain irrigation work in the hope of eradicating malaria.
Their schemes, however, had not been successful and this shewed that not all kinds of irrigation work were suitable for stamping out the disease.
The SECRETARY GEMMRAL had been informed that the Bulgarian Government desired to raise a small loan of about £4,000,000 for the settlement of refugees and irrigation works. The settlement of the Bulgarian refugees was of great importance for the restoration of good relations with that country's neighbours. The raising of the loan would, however, depend not upon the .eague, but upon the financial situation in the various European money markets.
Li. MADARIAGA stated that of the South-Arnerican countries only Brazil and Uruguay had so.far accepted the invitation to the ¿lay Conference on the Traffic in Arms. It was important that the argentine and Chile should be represented and he proposed to undertake private negotiations in Berne and Paris.
There was ome prospect of Mexico attending. Germany, Turkey ggd
the
/
-11-
United dtatos hud all agreed to attend the Conference.
,	Professor ^ffCLICO thought that more publicity should
be given to the Conference.
M. Ho A¡3 said that the mooting of the Committee on hoac! traffic held in Milan in the building of the Italian Automobile Club had been entirely successful. A revised tost of the 1909 Convention had boen approved. The Milanese papers, thanks to the energy of If. Gan.zoni, had given full details of the meeting and automobile clubs in all countries and shown great intorest.	The "dyndicat international des Chauffeurs"
had beon represented.
The dLiC.Ci'-i'iY G2EJ.A-L thought it most important that the fullest publicity for this meeting should be given in the motor-car press in a^ll countries and it was agreed that 1/1. Haas and hr. dweetser should confer on the subject.
Ivi. HixhiHi stated that Dr. HItobe was expected to land at Marseilles at the end of the following week. /hen in Japan he had addressed about seventy meetings and fifty thousand people .
dir Herbert a. Dd said that the dr it i ah and Drench contributions towards the expenses of arbitration in the matter of the Ottoman public Debt had been received.

Mr.	Purves, 3e
1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL 3rid that the total budget estimates for 1926 wovld be approximately equivalent to those for last year’s budget. He did not therefore anticipate any serious opposition on the part of the Commission of Control or the Fourth Commit tee of the Assembly,
2.	The SECRETARY-GENERA! desired next week to discuss with the various sections concerned the question of procedure for the forthcoming Conference on the Control of the Traffic in Arms.
3.	The Secretariat housing difficulty had now been solved, Owing-to the good offices of Sir Herbert ¿br.es. The Accounting.
Internal Control Officers Branch would go to the smaller vill and the Precis It i ting Section would join the Indexers in the larger Villa,
_ 9 ,
4.	The SECRETARY-GEN'S AI considered the recent debate held in the House of Commons on the Protocol satisfactory so far as the League was concerned. Careful reading showed that
Mr. Chamberlain had particularly insisted that any pact in which Germany might join must "be brought within the framework of the Letegue and that Germany must join the League*
5.	M. MADARIAGA stated that only three South American countries, namely, Brasil, Uruguay and Panama, had notified their acceptance cf the invitation to the May Arms Traffic Conference. Venezuela's participation might be taken for granted as M. Parra-Perez had telegraphed saying that he had been appointed as delegate to the Conference. M. Mello Franco had undertaken to place himself in touch,With the Governments of Peru and Ecuador and they were practically assured of the attendance of Chile and Colombia.
6.	M, COLBAN raised the question of the methods employed
by subordinate officials signing documents on behalf of a director in his absence. After some discussion it was decided that documents which were normally signed by a Director "for the Secretary-General" should, in the absence of the director', be signed "for the Secretary-General in the absence of the Director of the Section". letters signed by subordinate officials "for the Secretary-General" in the absence of directors should have been submitted either in draft or otherwise to the Secretary-General for approval unless they were simply interim acknowledgments.	x
A circular would be issued.
In special cases when the Director wa3 not -absent letters might be signed by a member of section "for the Director of the Section".
~3~
7,	Sir Herbert AMES referred to the very large budget surplus regaining over from 1924. After further discussion it was decided that the Financial Director should issue to directors a short statement in suitable form giving the main figures of the surplus and how it was constituted, Nothing should be said
in ther Press on the subject meanwhile.
8.	Dr. RAJCHMAiT said that the lie I aria Commission had finished its session the previous day and that a general report would shortly be issued on the results of its investigations in Russia and Italy. The report although lengthy, would be confined to the scientific end technical conclusions of that enquiry. The members of the Commission would this year visit Palestine,
t
Syria, Sicily and probably, Spain. It might, after these countries had been inspected be possible to propound some international doctrine as regards the treatment and suppression of malaria,. The Commission consisted of the best qualified specialists in Europe and would this year be joined by an American, who would be appointed by the Rockefeller Foundation, This was the first occasion on which the Foundation had participated directly in the Health work of the League. The Committee on Still Birth Statistics had just concluded it3 session.
10o M. 1IANT0UX referred to the reports appearing in the Press that the new Albanian Government was about to negotiate with the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government concerning the St, Naoum Monastery. It was hoped that an exchange of territory would be effected, but at present the Serb Government was unwilling to cede all the villages claimed by the Albanians.

II	I II U ï E S of tho Diroctors1 Meeting held on Wednesday, April 8th, 1925.
Present:
So crot ary-Genera1 Dr» Hitoho Sir Herbert Ames Dr * Van Hamel M. Comert Mr. Colban Mo do Madariaga Mr. Ab raham Mr. Gilchrist Mr. Oproscu Mo Pietromarchi Dr. Ho man Whito Mr. Walters M. Haas Mr. Buxton
Mr. Wilson (Secretary).
1» The SECF.ETA BY-GSH1XAL called the attention of the Diisctors to the fact that the rule whereby speeches at league mootings made in a language other than one of the official languages should be interpreted.. by an interpreter provided by the speaker appoarod to be falling into disuse. It would be dangerous if it became customary to expect the Secretariat to provide for the interpretation of such speeches. Phis applied specially to mootings of tho Council and to longue Conferences, but perhaps not to mootings of exports on technical questions.
He asked Diroctors to take such opportunities as offorod them-solves of reminding delegates what was the practice c£ tho League in this question.
2.	The meeting considered tho draft agenda for the 6th Session of the Assombly.
Tho SECEETAHY-GEHHKAL said that ho bolievod that the majority of reports on tho work of technical organisations had at tho 5th Session been included in the General Ho port on the
work of the Council and than roprinted, separately for tho use of tho Assembly, Was there any objection to tho continuance of this practico at tho forthcoming session?
It was stated that for health and transit questions this system had boon satisfnctor7«
11« HI Oil ILF CUE said that such had toon tho practico adopted lost year by the Financial Committee, but that the Economic Committee had sent, through tho Council, a special report to tho Assembly,
It was agreed that an attempt should be made to induce the Economic Committee to conform to tho practice of tho other technical committees. Emphasis was laid on tho necessity of having reports on tho work of all tho technical organisations ready for inclusion in tho main report on tho work of tho Council« Moreover, as complaints had been made that delegates to the Assembly he d had insufficient tine to study reports submitted to them, every effort should bo made to persuade Committees mooting after tho publication of the main report to moot as long as possible before tho Assembly, so that supplementary reports could bo embodied in the supplementary report on tho work of tho Council.
It was agreed that the report on the work of tho Committee on Intellectual Co-operation should bo addressed to the Council and by it transmitted to the Assembly, as last year.
In reply to M. IIADARIA&A, tho EECF-ETAEY-GSfEXAL said that there would be no special report on tho work of the Coordination Committee on Armaments; its work would bo dealt with in the report on the work of tho Council. The same applied to tho ouostion of special investigations, Tho private rx. nufactu.ro of arms and the May Conference on tho control 01 the- traffic in arms would be dealt with under Item G of tho agenda.
To SIR HERBERT AlOilS* enquiry whether the request of the last .Assembly that the Counoil should in certain evontualities which could not be determined till Jane report to tho next Assembly on the measures to bo taken to obtain money from defaulting States should be placed as a spocial itom on the itssombly agenda, the Secretary-General said that it would be too eurly in May, when the agenda was to be despatched to Members of the league, to determine whether these eventualities had ocourred, Should they actually occur, the item might perhaps be placed by the Counoil on the supplementary agenda of the assembly but this was a point for further consideration.
The SECRETARY-GENERA! agreed to send to Directors a oircular reminding them to give to M. Vigier as soon as possible material for the report on the work of the Council.
In reply to the SECEE121ARY-GENERA1, DR. NITOBE said that the report on intermunioipality would be ready in about three weeks and the report on youth questions would be prepared as soon as possible. Very few fresh replies from Governments had so far arrived.
The first sentence of Item G of the Draft Agenda was deleted. Item 23 of the agenda was deleted.
3.	DR. VAN HAMEL said that the Committee too enquire into the possibility of the progressive codifioation of certain questions of international law had just risen. It had drawn up a list of subjects which members of the Committee had agreed to study severally with a view to further proposals.
M. HAAS suggested that as soon as possible such technical organisations as might be concerned should be asked to moko observations from tho practical point of view on the Committee1a proposals.
DR. VAN HAMEL said that the list of questions drawn up by the Committee was very provisional, und that when tho individual studies of members had been completed, the Committee*s reoommendations would
Tse submitted to the CounoiL, which would doubtless consult the technical organisations whon nocossary.
Tho SECRET.APY-GENERAL thought that even so there wus a risk of reports on questions affeoting the technical organisations being prepared by members of the Committeo without the knowledge of the point of view of those organisations. He suggested that the Rapporteurs of the various questions should unofficially consult the presidents of the technical organisations concerned before drawing up their reports. Ho asked Dr. Van Hamel to oirculute tc the Directors interested a list of the questions formulated by tho Committee, so that Directors might indicate any on which tho informal consultation of the Presidents of tho technical organisations seemed desirable.
4,	IB. NITOBE spoke briefly of his visit tc Japan, a report on which he would later submit to the ¡¿ocrotary-G-eneral. The League cf Nations Union consisted of about 2,300 members, mostly influential people. The general public had so far not been touohed by its work and he found there a great demand for information about the League. Even in small towns none of his audiences had been less than 600 and speakers were expected to speak for at least an hour and .a half. The Prinoe Regent took a keen personal interest in international questions and Dr. Nitobo, beaides giving information to the Prinoe Regent, had spoken to a group of members of the Royal Family and of members of the Royal Household. He had also had the valued opportunity of addressing tho Privy Counoil, u body of some 23 rather elderly persons which nevertheless counted for most in Japanese politios. He addressed a group of Members of Parliament and also a group of employers. There was great interest in the attitude of amerioa to the League, and the decision of tho British Government to build a naval base at oingapore was generally regarded as being inconsistent with genuine support of tho League. There was much interest in such theoretical questions as the possibility of organising a super-Utato and of ubolishing war.
-5-
Sir HERBERT AI.TE3 gave the total figures for the iraft "budget of the League for 1926. This bddget which was the smallest for four years- about 22,500,000 Swiss frano3- might, he thought, now "be considered the normal "budget of the League.
"Dr, Norman "/HITS, recently returned from. Singapore, said that twelve administrations, of which six were British, had "been represented at the Conference held there last February, The spirit of the Conference had been excellent and there had been competition between certain countri es to help the work of the new Bureau by broadcasting information free of charge. The Bureau was already receiving telegraphic reports iron1, five countries; India would supply it with news about Aden and the Secretariat about the East Coast of Africa. There seems no doubt that all the countries concerned with the work of the Bureau would support it.
M. COLBAN said that within the last month much attention had been paid to minorities questions in the press of central and North-Sastern Europe. The present minorities procedure of the League was attacked on the grounds that initiative in complaint was the privilege of a member of the Council and that the texts of petitions and of the observations of Governments thereon were not published. These were old complaints which the League had already considered and met so far as possible.
It was, however, being recognised that the League accorded a real protection to minorities and that its work should be judged with patience. Behind this press campaign there was, he thought, concerted action of some kind, whose he did not know.
1-1. OPRESdU said that a recent meeting of the Jireoting Board of the International University Office had decided on the methods by which the proposed list of remarkable books in the. various countries should be drawn up. Lists would in the first
-6-
place tie sutiir.itted "by the National Corrmittees of Intellectual Cooperation for their respective countries. Each country had its qubta and the coir.plete list should include about 600 books, The list would be finally prepared by Hr. Hagbert Wright in Tondon who was ready to take on hiir.self the responsibility of the final selection®
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that it would cause ir.any jealousies if Hr. Hagbert '’fright were to delete any of the suggestions ir.ade by the various Corrjrittees.	The list ir.ight
thus be longer than desirable but this was the lesser of the two evils, Mr. Hagbert ’fright would still have the work of classification of the books under thejr various subject headings.
M. OPRESCU promised to irake this clear to Mr. Hagbert vright.
9»	Mo Leon DUEOUR said that the agreement for a loan to
the Municipality of Danzig had come into force on April 1st,

The SKCRnTARY-GLiNnRAL said that he had spoxen
with the president of the i/.osul Commission which had
returned to Europe. The report of the Commission
would not, as had been expected., be ready for dis-
cussion at the next meeting of the Council. It would
therefore be necessary either to call a special
meeting of the Council to discuss it when ready or to
begin the September session of the Council a day or
two earlier. The second seemed to be the better
alternative.
This being so, it seemed that the Council at
its next session would discuss no question of great
2.
public interest, although there might be some interest in the items relating to Austria, Minorities and Danzig., It was doubtful whether leading statesmen would in those circumstances be likely to attend the meeting.
Sir Arthur SnLTZH drew attention to the effect as regards the League which meetings of foreign secretaries of Great Powers at Geneva had on Germany: moreover,
Geneva was the only place where they could easily meet without giving rise to excited conjecture.
2.	The SZCRLTARY-GEln.RAL said that M. Ceresa , the Auditor, had not been able to como to Geneva in order to Audit the 1924 accounts. He had appointed a substitute to do so. Presumably the Supervisory Committee would accept the substitute's report and the Council would approve, as an exceptional measure, the delegation of powers made by M„ Ceresa.
3.	The SECRETARY-GEITZRAL said that statistics prepared by the Registry showed that there was little
increase for the first quarter of this year in the
number of documents registered, compared with the number a
for the/
Ô O
first quarter of last year. we was inclined to think from this ana other tokens that the ’.¿or.: of the Secretariat had, on the ¿¿hole, acquired a volume which might now remain more or less constant.
Sir ..rthur SaLï-IH thought that in the Secretariat, more than in any other organisation, registry statistics were an uncertain in de:-: of the amount of worm "being done. If, however, they were considered along with other criteria - the number of pages roneoer, etc. -they had some significance.
A*	!,r. IJIfOJi; said that . her g son had. decided to
convoke the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation
for the 11th ¡.ay at Paris. .-.e seemed to wish that
the Committee would at that session consider more definitely
the form of the proposed Institute in laris. ■
In reply to the Secretary -General, -hr. bitobe said that he thought the holding of the meeting in paris did not present any great difficulties, as the demand thereby made on the Secretariat staff would, be slight.
!.. OOL.^kT briefly described the situation created in Prance
by the arrival of the
new Government.
cir HEH3LET ai-iES said that the Supervisory Commission v/ould meet on the ‘.'9th end probably for a t*eek after that.
The ¿LCHET/iHY GEEnZAI hoped that the meeting might finish within a shorter ti. a and authorised Sir Herbert Ames to remind Directors that it %s desirable that they should be present when the parts of the 1926 Budget concerning them nore discussed.
Sir EEH3EET ADZS said that his Department proposed to make a special analysis of the relative sice of the various items of expenditure at the Arms Traffic Conference, gs it seemed reasonable tc take this as a typical League Conference. The analysis ’«ould thus be a guide for future estina tes.
Hr . ■ HO SI II; S' said that the report on procedure on Danzig questions mould be submitted to the parties concerned by the 10th Hay. On the question of post-boxes , the Court had decided to ask for a declaration from the Secretariat. It would say later whether it
desired a written or
oral declaration
5
The SECRETARY-GEEERAL seid that he would hesitate to authorise a member of the Secretariat to be subjected to cross-examination before the Permanent Court.
9. The SECRET GRY-GENERAL said that the President of the Arms Traffic Conference had not yet been chosen. He hoped the matter would be settled soon and he ashed the Disarmament Section and the Information Section to prepare a statement which might he used by the President in his openin’’ speech.
Commander HODGE said that 39 states had accepted invitations to the Conference and 5 had. declined. The others had not yet answered,
10. Sir Arthur SALTER said that the discussion on Austrian questions at the Council should be interesting* In the league’s work for the financial reconstruction of Hungary, the ”honeymoon period" had passed. The Hungarian Government had. raised the question of the disposal of the balance of the Loan and of an increase of salaries of officials. He thought that the Council would bo able to deal satisfactorily with those specific demands.
The Greel: Settlement Scheme v’ent well, although the Greek Government seemed unable to find the full amount of land required for the refugees. It was doubtful whether the loan ■■’ould nuite suffice but it would he impossible to obtain an extension of the loan in London at present, even though the League's prestige in these matters never stood so high.
. The SECRETARY GENERAL said that he would raise after K.Colban's return the nuestion of the method of the signature of letters by 'embers of Section in the absence of their respective Directors.

1.	The Graft provisional agenda of the 34th session
of the Council vr.a considered.
I ton 2. It v.t,c decided that this should ho divided into two items, (a)"Budgot for 1926 and accounts for 1924” ~ incluiing the first four subjects and the accounts for tlio gift of the llockofollor Foundation. Of those the first throe subjects should bo subnit ted to the As so ably for information and action, the rest for information only; (b) "Internal, financial and administrative questions" - being the last throe subjects in item 2.

T^c meeting was informed that an item would he added to the agenda "Application of International Treaties to Han d a t od Ar or. s ."
2)	The oECRIlfi'IRY-GiliriJA'i.L said that the iiupc-rvisoiy Commission, which hu-.d finished its consideration of the budget fer 1926, herd behaved very reasonably, The only chapter on which it
still so-emad to bo unnonvincod concerned the Health Organisation,
serious
and,without definitely proposing any/ cuts in this chirp tor it had decided to drew tho attention of the Assembly to the necessity of a balance bring preserved between tho Technical Organisations.
3)	Hr-. HAD Alii AGA said that tho Arms Conference herd art up two main committees, a general committee- and a military corami t too, and tho general committee had decided to sot up at once throe special coruiitto.-s. Ho had drawn attention to tho advisability of sotting up these committees only v/hon the need for any of them should be ironediat ly folt, but the only concession mod.; to this point of view had been that tho bureau of

I. The SEORETARY-GSNMR iL said that the Arms Traffic Oonfe^ence, the progress of which had at the first been encouraging, was now faced by four difficult problems :
a)	The British proposal that warships should be excluded from, the system, of publicity and licensing,.
This proposal was apparently based on the view that ships should not be subject to search in transit. Now that the transit provisions of the Draft Convention had been deleted, the main ground, for the British proposal seemed to have been removed8
b)	Maritime zones.
c)	The engagements assumed by Abyssinia. It wotild require careful legal study to determine exactly what these were.
d)	Russia. The countries contiguous to Russia objected to exports to them, being published while Russia was not a party to the Convention. It seemed doubtful whether the position would be much improved for these countries, even if Russia did adhere, as Russia's production of arms was mainly for internal purposes, and would, therefore, not necessarily be known.-

II* Ike SIGHT! '.HY- GINIH AL said that in Ion don, whence he had
just returned, the atmosphere seers’3 more favourable to the
League than ever before. The foreign Seeretar7 was anxious to
help the league in every way consistent with the general line
of nolicy which he hod adopted, but was not prepared to reverse
the direction of British foreign policy, as some persons
enthusiasts for the League seemed to think ho ought to do.
The foreign Secretary was of opinion that the Security Pact
negotiations could only succeed if Germany became a Member of
the league. The recent speech by Dr. Stresemann seemed to him
as
■'the Secretary-General)/rather disappointing, but as representing a slight advance towards the league*
m. The STOP I TAP 7- G1 NTH /.I said that the Irak Commission would not finish its report before about the middle of July.
It would probably bo circulated confidentially to the Members of the Council at the end of July, which was lato enough to enable it to be discussed at the September meeting of the Council, without the necessity of convoking a special earlier meeting.
IV,	Professor LTTDLICO drew attention to the material difficulties caused by the simultaneous meeting of several Commissions and Conferences. These difficulties were being acutely felt at present. The Secretariat should be jealous of the tradition of efficiency which, he thought, had been established in the service ox these Commissions. Ee suggested that, before a Commission definitely fixed the date of its next
session, the Secretary should consult Mr. Hus ton, and, if he
3-
xoúnd that the meeting' at. the date proposed would place too great a strain on the Precis Writing and other services, he should attempt to hr ye it altered.	/
The 3 aCPLT.'.R Y- GEN Thai	thought that it 3.hould he the
rule that general conferences, such as that now sitting, were hold either in the early snring or in' the autumn*
V.	Dr. YITOPS said that the recent meeting of the International•Oorrittec on Intellectual Ooouoration in Paris had studied the internal organisation of the proposed Institute, with a view to affording further information to the French donate. The scheme -drawn bp would he eeafrinod hy a Drafting Commit toe within a row days, and would he studied hy the Secretariat»-
The Polish Government had offered the sum. of Frs. 100,000 (One hundred thousand francs) to the Institute. VI. VII.
VI.	Dr. NIT OB 3 said that he had information that the Russo-
Japanese Treaty was being communicated to Geneva for registration.
VII.	I!. GOLD AY said that there would be the following Minority questions before the next session of the Council:
h) The Greek Protocol,- The reply of the Greek Government to the jues tionnaire of the Council was said to have been despatched from. Athens.
b)	Minorities in Lithuania. • The required information had not yet been obtained from. Lithuania»- The questions involved wer e ^alicate and the Rapporteur would attempt to treat the problem, as a general one,- and not as one affecting the Polish minority in particular.
c)	The Cferm.ano-Polish Hu tionality negotia tions.
Tho agreement df a,\7n up - t Vienna has boon ratified by the two parties. The Council would have to take cognisance of this agreement, in so far as it might be held to modify in certain respects the Polish Minorities Treaty,
d)	Minorities in Constantinople and /o3tern Thrace, negotiations between Athens and ='ngora wore proceeding, and it was hoped that these, with the assistance of tho League nominees on the Exchange of Populrtions’Commission, would result in v settlement.
e)	Hungarian Colonists in Transylranis. This was a new question^ and an import.- nt one, as it might lead to Poumania having to make a general statement on its Minorities policy.
VIII* M. C013AW	said that apparently the next session of the
Cou soil would bo distinguished by the absence ox any complaints concerning the Saar, nevertheless, one Saar question would be on the .agenda, namely, the disposition of certain documents which had been collected with a view to the. plebiscite, It was desirable that the Governing Commission should not be responsible for the preservation oi these documents.
IX, M. COLBAN said that, though the settlement of the Letter Box question had been provided for by the opinion oi the International Court, there still remained the subsidiary question of the delimitation of the -oort of Danzig. He would discuss th i S' v.r\t)i the ”a. oror teur,
Professor ATT*"1! IS0 said that the only real assista nce which the league could give'in the settlement of this question would be through the Transit Committee, It was a technical question,' in which neither tho Court nor the Rapporteur could be dn effective help.
?roir. recent indications Dr. van HAH3L perceived, end deplored, a diminution in the status ox High Commissioners,
How different -v s that office as exercised in Danzig, from. Gladstone's High Coirn’.issionership in the Ionian Islands.
The SHOT TTi.HY-GXNUAL did not think one could argue from, the position of the High Commissioner in Danzig that the office had become less important. It was expressly provided that the High Commissioner in Danzig had no administrative duties,
Xc The SECX5TARY~GDNDRfL	thought that the next session
of the Council ought to last no more than five days.

1.) With reference to the motor accident near Boirout, the SDOB2T 17.Y-GEI7E? AL said that the Council wculd doubtless wish to express its sympathy with the families of the ¿Victims and also its appreciation of tl.e action token ty the French Government, which seemed to have neglected nothing that, ought t o have been done.
He himslof took the epoortunity of thanking Dr. Eajchman and Dr. Homan irrhite for the way in which they had handled a painful situation.
The question might arise whether the League was under any financial obligation as a result of the accident. The mooting agreed that though the Le ague was under no such obligation of a legal kind, it had a certain moral obligation which the Council and Assembly would presumably uphold.
2» ) The SECuETAFT- G21IEKAI said that the situation of the Arms Conference seamed more hopeful then a week ago. There was a possibility that it mi-It fin.1^1 its W'k by the end of
n 9 m
the following week. The four difficulties which he had mentioned last week wore to some extent overcome, hut a now difficulty had arisen concerning the number of ratifications which would bo required to bring the Convention into force. Es hoped that a satisfactory formula would he found.
hr. Yan HAMEL pointed out that the proposed Convention departed from the now established procedure for Conventions drawn up under the auspices of the league, in that ratifications would be deposited, not with the Secretariat, hut with the French Government, This was a legacy of the provisions of the St. Germain Convsnticn.
3.) From the probability that neither hr. Sahm nor Mr. Skrynski would think it necessary to corns to the forth-
coming Council neotine for
discussion of the hanzisr items
on the agenda, Mr. COLMN augured the dawning of a brighter day in the leagued protection of the Free City.
4.1 Mr. SFESTSEB said that the meeting of the International Parliamentary Association at Washington next October would consider proposals for the Codification of International Law and for the Convocation of a new Hague Conference, It might be harmful to the league if this Conference considéréi these questions without recognising what the league had done. On the other hand, if the Members cf the Conference -were primed to advertise in its discussions the work cf the league the proposals before the Conference might hoist with their own petard the enemies of the League who had made them. The Question seemed to him important as the proceedings of tho suffer a publicity unknown in Europe.

Sir H23BEE? AMES said that the Members of the Association would, after the Conference, proceed at the inritation of the Canadian Government to Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. Their reception at Ottawa would be official and important. Ho himself was prepare 1 to write to Members of the Canadian Government suggesting that the interests of tho League should be defended at Ottawa and also by the Canadian Delegates at Washington, Eo wondered whether a snail committoo should hot be formed to consider what action Members of the Secretariat should tshe-
Tho SECPETiSY-GEBEPAL doubted whether it was necessary te form e committee. Nevertheless, he desired Directors and other Members of the Secretariat who were in touch with Parliamentary circles in their own countries to

MR. wIL-ON , Secretary.
I.	The "provisional agenda for the thirty-fourth session of the Council" (No.C.265 (1). A.100 (l) 1925) was approved without change.
II,	The SECRET.iRY-GEiM'.R^L referred to a passage on page 26 of M.Rappard’s hook "La Politigue de la Suisse dans la Eociete des nations" in which it is said that the chief
members oí the Secretariat of British, Trench and Italian nationality had the duty "de faire prévaloir" the views of their respective Governments in the Secretariat. He objected to the expression "faire prévaloir". It vías true that the chief nationals of great Powers on the «Secretariat had to keep in close touch ?iith their Governments because it was a fact that these Governments exercised a great influence in international politics. It v/as incorrect to say that these
officials should or did attempt to ensure the visto xy or the point of view oi their own Government in the Secretariat
The DDPUTi oSCRDfh:RY-G. TlDIbfL associated himself with the views of the secret erg-General,
Dr,-van IIalGIL agreed that Processor Ragpard's statement on this point was perhaps not cguite happily worded. He thought it an exaggeration to sap that the members belonging to the nationalities of the Great rowers were "absolute masters" in the "Secretariat. nevertheless , there log behind Processor aappard's statement a genuine apprehension or the Governments of small xowersj and it was essential that within the Secretariat the tendency to give leading members belonging to the great lowers an exclusive and collective preponderance should always be voided.	Dr.van Hamel added
that he -was sure that the Secretary-General shared this opinion.
mr. COLBiJ! said that he hoped that there ’would be discussed at a later Directors' meeting the guest ion of the increasing number of diplomatic representatives to the League stationed in-Gen _v: . Do ..¿thing should _e done to encourage

of the Council
3
IV*	Mr. GILCHRIST asked what had been the result of the
decision to prepare a trial three-monthly report on questions affecting the League for submission to the Council.
Dr. VAN HAKEL said that the first results seemed to show that Sections could report little that was not, included in the do cannonts relating to the items on the agenda of the Council. Only the Information Section could obtain the material required for the report.
M; COMERT said that a Secretariat Committee on this question existed which would go into the matter further.
y„	Sir Herbert AMES suggested that the meeting of the
federation of League of Nations Union Societies which was to he hold at Warsaw on July 5th might be used with a view to preparing, favourably to the league, the minds of delegates to the Congress of Inter-Parliamentfry Associations at Washington, in accordance with the decision taken at the last Directors' Meeting,
II. COHERE said he would bear this point in mini,
VI.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that complaints had been
made concerning the rather cumbersome formula of signature used by members of sections, in the absence of the respective directors, in signing letters for the Secretary-General,
namely, "for the Secretary-General .......... in the absence
of the Director of the X Section." It was argued that members of sections who had the responsibility of signing should have the right to sign on their ovn authority as being in charge of their respective sections,
4
I .To* n C-T * •) ;i TT i.J.I •
to avoid making sections, whoth
said that it was a tradition in the Secrotar distinctions of grade hetween memoors of er they he longed to A or B category, and the
i at
creation of anything approaching a class of "under-directors" was undesirable* for him the guestion raised hy the Secretary-General concerned not merely the signature of letters hut the organisation of the Secretariat as a whole.
S
Sir Arthur ShLf.Ji thought that wh ocretariat was authorised to sign a 1
.en a member .otter for th
of the
o Sccretary-
Genoral his signature was equal to that
of the Secretary-General
for the world outside. There was no need to draw attention to his status in the Secretariat. He proposed that letters signed for the Secretary-General, whether by a director or by a duly authorised member of section, should simply bear
the legend "for the Secretary-General" and the signature Similarly, letters signed by a member of section for the director should boar the legend "for the director of the Section" and the signature.
Br. V\H IIAlIHn said that it would be wrong to change on the spur of the moment an established procedure.
It was agreed that Dr. Van Hamel, Mr. Oolban and Sir Arthur Salter should form a committee to consider and report on the question.

Pr 6 VA1T HAMBL thought that thoro night bo a disposition to moot in a non irai city0
ïhe SnChilIAIY-GlfilE AL said that action at the Sixth Assembly on the security question might bo on one of tiro following linos;-
a)	. Before the Assembly not the Allied-Go man-Pact might have boon signed with the Arbitration Treaties relative there tc, and Go men y might hare applied to enter the league.
In this case the session of the Assembly would bo notable, and the Assembly would probably roe amend the adoption of other similar Pacts,with the result that in tine a series of defensive Pacts covering most European and some non-European countries might bo dram up.
b)	Alternatively - and this seemed norc/probab lo - tho Pact negotiations would still bo in progrès; . In that ease Germany might either apply for admission at tho Sixth Assembly or decide to wait until the Pacts were ccareludadThe socond course was more likely.
In the latter case, a special Assembly v/ould probably bo convoked for the admission of Germany so soon as the Pacts should have boon concluded and tho application of Germany received. The Sixth session of tho Assembly would thus bo chiefly occupied with the technical work of tho league and would probably not carry the subject cf security and arbitration much further, though it night press for tho signature of tho optional clause of tho C urt.

This ho thought to be an unlikely event, and he chained the right of ling li oh illogicality to consider ah at should then be done only if and when it should bo necessary* Professor A2T07,IC0 thought that oven if the Pact negotiations wore still proceeding the Assonbly night try to take sorao action in the security problem. This ho th right dosirablo. Host of the dologations at the Assembly would not bo directly affected by the present Pact negotiations, and the pacific zeal of the last Assonbly should, bof ore it caused to flow, bo canalises, in so to useful direction, such as a more general signature of the optional clause and the one our agon out of arbitration treaties.
The 2D31 iE TiiHY-GIllOv AL hoped that in any ease the
1 cave	t he.	Protocol	intact as a	.n object to	bo
inod 5	and	that dilu	tion of it	with v. view	t 0
making it acceptable would not bo attempted*
He HAFTOPZ agreed, but thought that the discussion of
contain	ph aso s	of the Protocol,	such as
the nggr	css or s	could hardly be	avoided „
The	SCCTdlf	Air/- GUIDE AL s a id	that the
in the Pact negotiations would probably bo engaged in consider ing c definition of aggression for the purpose of the Pact, and the so would probably refrain iron a general discussion. Dover thole so , only good could coney iron a ventilation of the Assembly1 s views on aggression.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER thought thut it would be useful to
prepare drafts of possible alternative non-justifiable disputes. At present
systems of arbitration in each new arbitration treaty
he d to be drafted froir. the beginning, whereas if types of arbitration were formulated much unnecessary work would be saved. The SECRETARY GENERAL said that Sti-tes actually engaged in negotiating arbitration treaties might resent any appearance of the Assembly attempting to prescribe the form of such treaties*
Nevertheless, he thought that it would be wise if the Legal Section were to collect arbitration treaties and study them with a view to disengaging their general -principles and formulating their various types. Either the Council or the Assembly might at some time ask for this information«.
The SECRETARY GENERAL
said that the Report of the Mosul
Commission should be received by the Secretariat about the middle of July and be ready for distribution to members of the Council by the beginning of August, The Council had decided to hold it3 pre--Assembly session two days earlier in order to consider this Report, There seemed some possibility, which he hoped would be avoided, that the Commission might meet at Brussels for the final drafting of the Report.
Mr. SHEETSER asked whether any means could be suggested for avoiding premature publication of the Report, Could the Report be published as soon as it was distributed to members of the Council, or, alternatively, could a press summary be issued?
The SECRETARY GENERAL thought that either course would be inadvisable; all that could be done was to ensure that no leakage occurred from the Secretariat. Of course it would be possible for the President of the Commission, in communicating the Report, to suggest to the President of the Council that it might be published a week after its receipt at the Secretariate
~5—
Sir ARTHUR SALTER suggested that publication might be authorised as aooh as the Report reached the members of the Council arid Turkey.
Professor ATTOIICO thought that it would be better to wait to see if any leakage did Occur and then to asik for this permission,.
Dr. VAN HAMEL hoped that there would not be a repetition of the misunderstandings that had occurred over the Upper Silesian Report. It would be wise if this Report stated its reasons more fully than had the Upper Silesian Report.
The SECRETARY GENERAL said that the trouble over the Upner Silesian Report lird been that the actual frontier line was known before the Report was known. He thought the publication of the Mosul Reoort before the Council had taken its final decision might lead to most unfortunate uncertainty in the territory subject to division, and that, grave though were the chances of premature public?: tion, it was better to attempt nothing further than to secure absolute secrecy in the Secretariat*
VI.	In reply to Dr. Rajchm.cn, the SECRETARY GENERAL said that
he thought it unlikely that the present troubles in China would come before the Assembly unless submitted to it by China.
711,	Mr. COLB AN hoped that Directors would take every
opportunity of impressing on interested persons the very substantial work which was being done by the Council even when not in Session in Minorities, Saar nd Danzig questions, and especially of dispelling the illusion that the formal postponement of some of these questions to a later session of the Council was due to laziness or fear. Ror instance, the postponement of the subject of Lithuanian minorities had been necessary, in order that the questions put by the Lithuanian representative- some twenty in number - several of which had been
-6-
answorn ed by "the Council, could he given further study before the Council took its decision.
In the Greco-Bulgerian question the Council had done a big political work by assuring the effective protection of minorities in Greece, end it might else be said, by teking a firmer grasp of the whole Balkan problem, than ever before«, Postponement of the Greco-Turkish minorities problem, had been made to facilitate and not to defer the decision. The decision on the disposal of the Saar plebiscite documents showed the thoroughness of the Council in the performance of its functions with regard to the future plebiscite. The fact that there had been no hint of Saar trouble at tho last session of the Council was evidence of the satisfactory work that the Council had done,
It w s usual in the German press to accuse the league of not knowing its own mind in Danzig matters, but the adoption of the new rules of procedure had meant much work, and while designed to decrease the number of Danzig questions brought before the Council it indicated an even greater interest by the League as a -whole in Danzig matters0
Briefly, the constructive work of the Council should bo judged not simply by the minutes of its meetings, but after taking account of the work being done between sessions, Could not this be made clear in the press?
Mr, STEBTSEE said that at the moment of decision by the Council directors were usually too busy to give the Information Section the nows which the press needed. As it was, the Information Section did all it could by delegating members to follow the work of different sections.
Dr. P.AJuHMAN suggested that the Sections should delegate members to assist the Information Section,
VIII
EX»
-fr-
K, GOLBAN said that lie could do more to help the Information Section in this matter after August, when his Section would be more completely staffed, for the present, he wanted to emphasise the need of individual reminders by Directors to their friends of the work which the Council did between its sessions as well as at their. 0
Sir AH THU:'? SAIT3R said that the opening speech at the Sixth Session of the Assembly by the president of the Council would afford a good opportunity for reminding the world?that the Council worked between sessions.
Mr„ GILCEHI3T so.id that eight reports on mandated territories had boon received, of which seven would be discussed at the forthcoming session of the Mandates Commission.
Dr. RAJGKMAN, reverting to the Secretary-GeneralTs statement that the sixth session of the Assembly might he chiefly occupied with the technical work of the League, drew attention to the disastrous consequences which attended the current practice of the nomination of persons ignorant of tho work under review as presidents or rapporteurs
of Commissions. Though as regards health he would attempt to ensure that members of the Health Committee were as far as possible attached to delegations, he wondered whether it would not he possible to appoint Presidents and Rapporteurs better acquainted with the subjects under
discussion
-8
The ¿ECKSTARY GEHERMI» thought that the situation would he Improved If the presidents of the teohnioal committees wh# were invited to attend the assembly commissions were given more opportunity to speak,	*'
hi. HAAS, while agreeing with Dr. Rajchmanrs estimate of the oapaoities of previous presidents and rapporteurs, denied that the results were disastrous.
Sir ARTHUR &AITER asked whether an ignorant rapporteur who accepted the draft report prepared by the Secretariat was more noxious than an instruoted rapporteur who might not accept the Secretariat1 s draft.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that the time had eome when the Assembly should appoint pros!dents of its committees on the ground of competence rather than nationality« So should international conferences held under league1 s auspices. It was competence to proside, rather than knowledge of the technical subjects under discussion, that was required.
Tho SECRETARY GrSRSF.AL said that the question was not simple, as-it was an honour to be a member of the Bureau ox the Assembly, and consequently various national claims had to be taken into account in tho nomination of presidents of committees.. Nevertheless, in view of tho exceptional importance of the technics 1. work at tho loaguo at the Bixth Session «¡f the Assembly, it was hopod that a competent president would be chosen for the Second Committee..
A. MARTDUX said that information ho had received concerning
\
Memsl showed that, the situation would remain troubled, and possibly become dangerous, unless the Convention were quiokly ratified and put into effect.	\
-9-
Me HaAS agreed. All that was necessary now was that the Procès-Verbal of the deposit of ratifications should he made,
XI.	The EECHETARY GEEBRAL said that he wished the Directors
to give their views on the following hypothetical case:-
If a Government comp ltd no.I that one of its subjects sitting as a member of a League Commission the members of which were not choson as Government représentatives > had acted, in tho course of his wort, in a manner which the Government disapproved, and if the Government suggested that the Council
y
should withdraw the nomination of the offendor as a member of tho Commission, what action should be talien?
Professor ATÏ0LIC0 thought that it was desirable to avoid the possibility of the Council appearing in opposition to the Stute concerned, Como otatos, especially small Gtatos, might consider their prestige effendod by an adverse decision of the Council, Would it therefore not be wise tc uso the Commission itself as a screen between the Council and the State concerned?
If the Commission were to inform the Council that it hod ascertained the facts and concluded that the member Impugned had acted rightly, the Council could refuse without opprobrium to consider his dismissal. Could a Government rosent such an expression of opinion by the Committee?
The SECRETARY GERERAI thought it was difficult to lay down a general rule. If the allegation was that the member of the Commjsoion had exceeded his mandate as such it would seem right that the President of the Commission should report on the correctness of such an allegation.

MINUTES 0? DIRECTORSf MEETING Wediaesday, 24th June ,1925,
Present : The SECRET/RY-GENERAL Professor ATTOLICO Dr„ Van HAMEL M. MMTOUX Ma COLBAN M. COMERT M„ CAT AST INI Ur, BIELER Mr, H ARAD A
Mr. WILSON, Secretary,
The SEC RET AF;Y- GENEE AL raise! the question of the position of diplomatic representatives to the League stationed in Geneva, of which a preliminary discussion had taken place at the DirectorsT Meeting of June 5, 1925 „
The question appeared to him to fall under two heads:
l)	the relations of these representatives with the Secretariat and 2) their relations with the Federal Government. He asked M. Colban, who had raised the question at a former meeting to give his views.
M, COLBAN said that while formerly there were no more of these representatives at Geneva than the members of the Secretariat could keep occupied and contented, this "Corps Diplomatique" was now growing. Its members could not receive the same individual attention from the Secretariat and there was consequent dissatisfaction, Some effort should be made
2
to take more notice of them - not only of heads of delegations "but of their secretaries. In particular their "intérêts de protocole" should he safeguarded« Perhaps the most important service that the Secretariat could do them would be to discuss with the federal Government their rights as diploms.tic representatives in Geneva with Deference to Article 7 of the Covenant.
The problem seemed to call for a reconsideration of a suggestion formerly made by hr. van Hamel that the Secretariat should have a "Service de Protocole" which could assist delegates and visitors to the League in general in their relations both with the Secretariat and with one anothere
To sum up;, his object at present was to state the problem and not to offer solutions. The problem seemed to him to have three as eels : l) the relations of the representatives with the Secretariat; 2) their relations with the Federal Government; 3) their relations with one another as members cf a body of representatives accredited to the League,
It was possible that the question might be raised by
T '
some delegate at the Assembly, when it would be useful that the Secretariat should have carefully studied its various as p e c ts «
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the whole problem was difficult. Representatives seemed to fall into the following classes:
1)	Representatives cf distant countries, such as Brazil ;
2)	Representatives of countries which had close relations with the league in some special subject (minorities or other), such as Poland; 3
3)	Representatives cf countries which had some special -reason for representation (e,-.gt the desire to assert their status internationally), such as Ireland„
3
So long as these categories were not enlarged there was no
’CilGTG \i.j\	:ld be very great
^dCi'^'d	Diploma tique"
great danger.
which., apart from the Council and other organs of the League attempted to formulate a league policy. For this reason he had strongly opposed the appointment cf representatives of high diplomatic rank, except in very exceptional, oases 0 The present problem was therefore hew to establish better relations with representatives actually in Geneva, while preserving the principle that this method of representation should he used only when necessary..
Dr, van HAMEL said that many of the representatives here were certainly dissatisfied. There was a feeling that their dignity was not properly respected, For instance, their reception at the Council - when they represented '¿heir Governments there •• was not felt to be in keeping with the grandeur of the occasion. On the other hand, if they were treated more solemnly, the growth of a. large "'Corps Diplomatique”, which it was intended to avoid, might he encouraged,
M> MAffOUJ. emphasised the point made by the Secretary-General that the formation of a be Gy of important diplomatic representatives at Geneva was very undesirable, as it would tend to trouble the tradition of genuine international co-operation which was taking root in Geneva, The problem was therefore not how to increase their importance as a body but how to please them better individually»
Dr» van HAMEL thought that the best method would be to discuss the question privately with one or two persons, such as M„ Mello Franco,
The SBCHBTAlY-GEiJEIvAL asked Dr, van Hamel, M-.Mantoux and M, Colban to examine the problem as defined in the discussions of the meeting.
He asked any ¿ire3tors who wished to do so to send their observations to It, van Hamel,
The SEC RE T ARY - GEN ER AL referred to the Secretariat Committee which had followed the work of the Arms Conference independently of the Secretariat of the Conferencet and had reported to him on points which arose in the debate which might render ratification difficult. The Committee seemed to him to have done useful works
Professor ATTOITOO thought that the appointment of such a committee should not necessarily he repeated.
Mo de MADARIAGA considered that the Committee at the Arms Conference had been useful, as affording: an independent view of the progress of the Conference, and especially because it was connected with the Secretariat of the. Conference through Me Nisot, as legal adviser of the Conference, but he was not so convinced of the utility of such a Committee as to hold that one should be appointed at every Conferencet
Dr, van HAMEL thought that perhaps too little use had been made of the legal advisor at the Arms Conference, with the result that the Secretariat of the Conference proper had been over-worked„ At future Conferences the work should bo better distributed.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL concluded that the question whether future committees of the kind should be appointed was left open.
The SBCRETARY-GENERAL said that ho had been asked whether the Rules of Procedure at future Conferences might not provide for the maintenance of an interval of 24 hours at the end of the Conference, in which the texts of the instruments to be adopted should be carefully examined from the formal point of view and the correspondence of the two languages
- 5
verified* If this was thought desirable, should the interval take place between the final reading and the signature of the Convention or between the semi-final and the final readings?
Dr„ van HAMEL said that he had come sail;/ to the conclusion that the indecent haste in which League Conferences finally adopted and signed Conventions was unavoidable, owing to the insistence of delegates to go away at the earliest possible moment»
M. MADARIAGA hoped that something might be done to avoid a repetition of the hurry in which the Arms Convention had been finally prepared for signature. The problem seemed to him to be twofold: l) to ensure that the text finally adopted by the Conference represented the true intention of the Conference, and 2) that the text signed was the same as that adopted. So far Conferences had concerned themselves little with 2), trusting to the Secretariat to see that the texts sisned by delegates were right. What was indispensable was that after all amendments had been introduced in the text at the last reading of the Convention there should be an interval of 24 hours before the final text was formally adopted by the Conference. The text would then be prepared for signature at the closing meeting.
Professor ATTOLICO thought that the ’’appel nominal” for signature which had taken place at the Arms Conference was undesirable. It constituted an indirect pressure on States to sign. A Conference should end with the Presidents speech and the Convention would then be open for delegates to sign when they chose.
M. MADARIAGA said that the "appel nominal" had been adopted at the Arms Conference on the suggestion of the American delegation, which the President of the Conference, not having time to çonsult the bureau, had accepted.
6
Dro van HAMEL said that the method was not in accordance with precedent»
The SECRETARY-GENERAL concluded that it was a question which should be decided by the Conference itself or by the bureau.
With reference to the interval in the last stages of the adoption of a Convention, he suggested that a short
paper might		be prepared by the Legal Section to	be sent to
the	member	of the Committee on Codification of	International Law
who	was deal	ing with the subject of Internationa	.1 Conferences ,
and	that in	future draft rules of procedure for	Conferences
should have some such provision as that proposed»
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that his attention had also been called to the unfortunate impression created by Article 20 of the Prms Convention, under which the nationals of a member of the league (Persia) were qualified as ’’natives "s He agreed that this designation was unfortunate, but could not see that the League could remedy the situation. If Persia raised the question at the Assembly it would certainly be held that the Assembly could not make any change in an instrument adopted by a Conference of delegates of sovereign States.
Perhaps the President ox the Assembly should rule the question out of order if it was raised.
Professor ATTOIICO thought that an expression of opinion on the question could not be prevented at the Assembly, but any decision by the Assembly was impossible.
LT„ MANTOUX said that a letter had come from LLComnene requesting the Secretary-General to send to the Council ” a titre documentaire’’ certain extracts which he had enclosed from speeches by Hungarian politicians expressing dissatisfaction with Hungaryrs territorial status.
7
That rooly should be sent to this letter? The proposed oommunication to the Council seemed undesirable -■ the statements had appeared in the Press and mere not directly connected with the Ie£guers work., nevertheless, in view of the request, a mere acknowledgment of receipt might be resented, ''That the Secretariat should do first was to enquire if M. Comneners request represented a formal demand by the Roumanian Government,
Mo Kantoux road the text of the reply which it was proposed to niaie.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL recalled that when, a little over a year ago, the Persian Government had asked for the circulation to members of the League of a document not bearing directly on the work of the League, the directors1 meeting had been of opinion that no general principle for the action to be taken on such requests could be established. The difficulty of the position was increased by the fact that though technically the information submitted by M, Comnene did not concern the League, it could be considered by Roumania to be, of interest to the Council as having a bearing on minorities questions and on the attitude of Hungary as a result of her financial restoration» He though t that by as 1:ing whe ther the request was to be considered as a formal request by the Roumanian Government - and the omission of the formula ?îdY ordre de mon gouvernement’7 in Mo Comnene rs letter justified the Secretariat in making that enquiry - and by intimating as in M„, Mantouxv draft reply that the document would, if sent to the Council, also have to bo communicated tc Hungary, might induce M. Comnene to withdraw his request.
Mo COLLAR said that the Secretariat had previously secured the withdrawal of requests of this nature by a carefully-worded reply suggesting that the document was communicated for the information of the Secretariat.
8
Professor ATTOIJGO thought that the Secretariat was under no obligation to circulate documents which did not refer to business actually before the League* M. Oomnene could be ashed privately to what question under consideration bjr the League the communication referred. If he could give no such reference the Secretary-General could reply that he had no rules to guide his action on the receipt of such requests and that he would submit the matter to the Council.
Dr. van HAMEL also insisted that the Secretary-General was under no obligation to act on the request unless it referred to business before the League.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he did not wish to make a reply which would unduly limit the powers of the Secretariat in the communication of documents of that kind. Though he hoped it would be possible to secure the withdrawal of this reauest, he could imagine cases innwhioh the League might be usefully employed as a means of making a general statement of policy, and that this was a privilege which small countries particularly might value. Moreover, there was something to be said for international recriminations, if they had to be made, being made through the League, which could then have a certain control over them.
M. OCT BAD said that there was reason to believe that the present request was merely a prelude to others of a.more far-reaching kind. He agreed with the Secretary-General that he could not definitely refuse a formal•request from a government, but he could say that where he had no clear rules to guide him he could ask for the authority of the Council before
communication
9 _
Mo CCIvEEPT thought that the suggestion to ask whether the letter was to to considered as being by order of the Roumanian Government was wise, and if the reply was affirmative the documents could be communicated in this case. Then the Secretary-General could ask the Council for a ruling for future guidance.
It was_agreed that hiId^n toux _shquld draw up the final text cf a reply, taking into consideration Jbhe views put forward by the directors.

The SECRETARY GENERAL referred to M. Corme ne
letter of June 6th, which had been the subject of discussion at the last Directors Meeting. He said that after the reply to that letter had been sent it had been found out that the letter had been left in the Secretariat by mistake and had so found its way to the Registry. The Secretariat's letter had been recovered, if. Comnene's letter returned, and the incident was therefore closed.
from the Turkish Government complaining in strong terms that the British Government was causing to bo bombed and murdered persons in Mosul who had spoken before the Mosul Commission in favour of part of the Province being assigned to Turkey. The Turkish Government asked that their letter should be distributed to the Council and that the Council should send out a commission of enquiry. In view of the gravity of the accusations the Secretary-General had, with the authorisation of the President of the Council, asked the British Government to make its observations thereon and had informed the Turkish Government that as soon as

the Tur ki s h le t ter
these observations wore received they and would be communicated to the Council. He hoped that the British reply would be such as to render a special mooting of the Council unnecessary« It would then suffice that the matter should come, if necessary, before the September meeting of the Council,by which time it was hoped that the report of the xlosul Commission would be ready.
The SLCiiLTidRY GBKLliAL said that he had at,tended the last meeting of the Ciraolo Committee in Paris. The Committee had drawn up a plan for international relief in calamities which provided for an initial fund to be contributed by governments of £25,000 of which £15,000 would bo invested for the overhead charges of the proposed organisation, and the remainder would bo available to provide the immediate relief necessary in a calamity before voluntary •'contributions came in. The scheme would come into operation when twelve States
hod ratified and £15,000 obtained. Its more eager supporters wished a protocol to be opened at the Sixth Assembly. He himself hoped that the scheme would ultimately be adopted but thought that its chances of adoption would be better if the Sixth assembly merely discussed it and sent it to governments for their observations, so that a protocol would not be opened at the next xi.ssenbly .
In reply to nr. Yxli HhLxiL the 3hCHL7_-JSY GrEltlRAl
explained more fully the stages in the administrative procedure which would be- followed:- Under the Resolution whereby the reports of committees mooting between the June session of the Council and the Assembly would be forwarded for their information without awaiting the approval of the Council the report of the Ciraolo Committee would be so forwarded. He would ask the authority of the President of the Council to/
send the scheme net only to Komberg of the League hut to the United states and to Germany?, as there were representatives of t- e American and German Hod Cross on the Committee. The Scheme would be discussed at the Sixth Assembly which would then ask the Council to refer it to governments for their final observations.
A Protocol embodying the scheme could then be opened e i ther before or at the Seventh Assembly.
The SLCAnT.ii.KY GLKLRaI said that he expected to go to England for a month on July 5th.
M. Leon DUPOUL resumed the work of the recent Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce held at Brussels. The Congress had been attended by over 60C delegates many of them associated with the work of the League. In the general discussions of the Congress on the reconstruction of Europe Sir Arthur Salter had spoken, .and in particular had shewn how much the Dawes Plan owed to the experience obtained by the League in the financial reconstruction of Austria and Hungary. The Congress .hid dealt with a large number of technical questions most of them of great interest to the League, end had asked the collaboration of toe League for the study cf many of them. It had recommended that efforts shoula be made to secure the more general ratification of the League's Convention on Customs formalities, at the closing session, one of the most important speeches - that by Air. Stxeat - had been devoted entirely to a review cf the economic and financial work of the meague.
Mr. BILLLK said that Sir Herbert Ames had been privately informed that H. Landurand would be head of the Canadian Delegation to the Sixth Assembly .and also that Sir George Forster would be one of the Canadian Delegates at the Inter-Parliament ary Conference at Washington.

9.	In reply to>. I70GUIERA the SECRETARY GENERAL said that information concerning the Turkish letter could be given to the press only when that letter with the British observations, was communicated to the Council and members of' the league and information concerning the Giraolo scheme when the Report ox the Committee was distributed to Members of the league.
10.	The 3LCRLrIMRY GLIILEnl said that the reading cf the full text of the debates in the British House of Commons on the Pact proposals revealed a fact, which had not appeared in the press, that members of all parties had spoken of
the Covenant as the corner-stone of British policy, and that enquiry concerning tec Pact was directed largely to the question of its compatibility with the Covenant.

M. MANTOUX said that the report of the Commission of Enquiry was boing distributed«

Sir Arthur SALTEH said that he was strongly of opinion that they should be borne by the ILeagus.
Item 5 fd) Transfer in the Budget for 1925,
Sir Herbert AMES said that the wording of this item, was not clear. It was intended to refer to transfers for which the approval of the Council was still required, Ho would submit a revised wording,
7ith reference to Item 5, Sir Herbert AMES said that sooner or later the Council would have to decide the following point:
Of the sums advanced to the representative of the Council,
M» Picard, ‘order Article 107 of the Treaty of Lausanne, all had been repaid except 25 Turkish pounds, M. PicardTs successor had been asked to pay this sum and h-ad not done so. As the sum was advanced out of the working capital of the League, it was necessary under the financial regulations, if it could not be collected, to ask the Council to declare it an uncollectable balance.
•71 th further reference bo Item 5, Professor ATTOIICO said tha he thought it would be better if the foriror procedure were once more adopted, whereby separate reports on each of the financial

Mr, GILO HR LSI' said that the report would soon be circulated, The Committee had been handicapped by lack of information, but had. in its report, proposed measures dealing with the various-hinds of slavery or forced labour which existed, Its covering letter to the Council contained 12 or 15 suggestions on these matters. By a small majority the Committee had suggested that some of these points might be included later in an international convention.
In reply to the Acting SECRETARY-GEMERAIi, Mr., GILCHRIST said that the functions of tho Committee would be considered as ended unless the Council asked the Committee to continue its work,
In reply to Hr, van HAMEL, Mr. GILCHRIST said that there wore no minority reports attached to the report of tho Committee, but that the report contained one or two dissentient footnotes by certain members,
Item 9. Report of the Economic Committee.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that this report would be ready only n short time before the meeting of tho Council. This was also the case fir Item 10: Report of tho financial Committee. In fact it seomsd as if the financial Committee, in view of the urgency of the questions which it treated, would always have to meet
immediately before the Council,
The Report of the Experts on the Enquiry into Economic Conditions in Austria (item 12) should be ready ¡About the middle of August.
Item. 14:	Right of Investigation in virtue of the Treaties
of Peace,
M. MADARIAGA said that he would submit a revised wording of this item.
After some discussion it was decided that as this item had been postponed by the Council, and as it was not. certain that the Council would consider it at the forthcoming session, the item should be followed by the words "pour mémoire";
(the resolution of the Council postponing the item, would then be quoted.)
Item. 15, Request of the Arms Traffic Conference that the Council should bring the Protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of poisonous gas to the notice of the Committee of Jurists for the Codification of International Law,

4.	Sir Arthur 3AIT3R raised the question of principle
underlying Item 15 of the draft provisional agenda; namely, the Request of the Arms Traffic Conference that the Council should bring the protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of poisonous gas to the notice of the Coirjr.it tee of Jurists for the codification of International law,
Por three reasons he thought it unwise that the League should in any way sponsor this proposal
1) Ho thought tho League ought to have nothing to do with any regulation of the conduct of war. v/ith regard to war, as formerly with regard to duelling, it was possible to have one of two attitudes; either to elaborate a code for its gentlemanly conduct, or to brand it as a crime. He hoped that the second attitude would be adopted with regard to war.
Secondly, scientists Questioned whether the employment of g:.s was more cruel than that of other arms.
Thirdly, no State at war would observe conventions for the rules of war unless it found it convenient to do so. Tho League's task was to facilitate the promotion of effective international agreements. By sponsoring agreements which in certain circumstances were bound to be broken, the League would be exhausting the limited capital of public faith in tho value of international agreements.
For these reasons ho hoped that the League would dissociate itself formally from any connection with the rules
of war.
-6
M. MaDASIAGA ugrcod with Sir ¿irthur Sal"or in substancec ho or pled nod how the Protocol in Question he a boon drown up by the Arms Traffic Oonforonoo, end gave it os his opinion that if the- Council wished to refuse tho request of the Conference, it should do so frankly by a statement of principle on tho linos of Sir art hur Salter's argument,,
Professor ATTOLICO also agreed on tho general question, but thought tho method proposed inopportuno. The- request of tho Conference should bo transmitted to the Codification Committee purely and simply for information and in the most mo dost and, as it were "bureaucratic" manner possible.
The ACTIHG— dhl CRETAEY-GEHERAl agreed, with Professor Attolico that it would bo inopportune to seek from the Council a general statement as proposed. It was best that this particular affair should be dealt with from an administrative point of view and that in tho procedure to bo followed o solution of tho difficulty should bo sought.
Dr. van* HAJuHi said that there was quite c largo body of pcacofully-mindod people who thought that the codification of tho laws of ’war was useful. This was especially so in tho older generation, and therefore it could not be hoped that tho Council vould oxpross tho unanimous opinion desired. On the other hand, somo members of the Codification Committee wore anxious to do this work, and once transmitted to the Committee, it might be difficult to bury the question.
A. IalHTOUX agreed that public opinion was divided on this question end it was inadvisable to offend a portion of it.
dir arthur ‘oAIiTER asked whether it would bo possible for the Council to define the mandate of the Codification Committee so as to exclude the laws of war..
-7 -
Dr. von HrMEL explained that tho Commit too had he on loft free to draw up its cwn programme end at the last moment had decided to insert end roeorro tho quostion of tho laws of war« This programme had still to ho submit tod to the Council.
Tho hCT'I liG’-^ECES'lhfR Y- GEl'IEKiTj thought that the no facts made it possible to foresee a solution. Tho Council ooalu adopt an expectant attitude» It could decide to postpone consideration of tho request of the Conference until tho Codification Committoo should hoTC laid before tho Coimai? its dofinito progr-emmo.
Before then tho Codification Committoo itself might have decided to exclude consideration of the laws of war, which Dr. van Hamel had stated that, with difficulty, the Committee would ptobably bo prepared to do.

As regards Article 16, it now depended on what the Gorman attitude would be. The b treason a ru note had been concerted with all parties in the Reichstag, and it night, therefore, ho that they would bo unwilling to abate any of their demands.

1,	The SECRETARY GENERAL said that several questions relative to the Sixth Session of the Assembly required consideration.
The first was the appointment of a Secretariat Committee to consider various matters concerning the organisation of the Assembly, such as the appointment of the Secretaries to Assembly Committees, the days on which Committees should meet, the distribution of the Agenda amongst Committees, The Committee should draw up a memorandum which could be considered at the next Lirectors’ meeting. Be suggested that, as last year, the Committee should consist of Mr, Walters, Mr, Lenis, Mr. Huston and Mr. Vigiex.
2.	The next question was whether the Presidents of .advisory Committees should be invited to attend the Assemoly in order/
to give information to Assembly Committees when required. He thought it best that each Secretary of an Advisory Committee should consider whether the President of his Committee should be invited, to attend or whether there would be enough persons on the delegations acquainted with the is'ork of the Committee to give the information required.
3,	Sir Arthur SAL 112 said that there appeared to be a presumption that the President of the Second Committee should not he a member of one of the Technical Organisations whose work
was discussed by that Comui cteo ,
The SECRETARY GENERAL said that though the appointment of the President of Committees raised certain complicated questions there was no need to exclude a suitable delegate on the ground that he was a member of a Technical Organisation.
4.	In reply to a question put by Mr. oo MADARIAGA, the SECRETARY GERERAI» said that he thought it would be best if the number and functions of the Committees were the same as last year. It was possible that this year the Third Committee might have little to do, but one never knew. He thought the Committees should be constituted as in previous years. Moreover he was of opinion that the same Committees should meet
on the same days as at last Assembly, namely, Committees 1,
2	and 6 should meet on the same day, and Committees 3, 4 and 5 on another day. This combination alone seemed to be satisfactory .
Sir Herbert AiaLS asked whether the same delegates should be encouraged to sit on the same Committees as formerly.
The SECRETARY GERERAI» said that this question raised the general question of the selection of Presidents of Committees and of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. This/
year nost European countries would be represented by their Foreign Ministers. Countries so represented would expect to have their representatives on the Bureau of the Assembly, either as Presidents of Committees or as Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. Appointment to these positions was being considered more and more as a political matter and this being so he thought it would be dangerous for the Secretariat to make suggestions. Probably the best compromise between the requirements of policy and efficiency would be that the Presidents of Committees should be the important personages and that the rhle of Rapporteur should be enlarged and performed by delegates well acquainted with the work under discussion.
Mr. HAAS thought that the important personages should be Presidents and the experts yrce-Presidents of the Committees.
The former would probably attend the Committees but little and the Vice-Presidents would then be the effective Presidents.
Professor aT’POLICO thought that the Secretariat should make up it3 mind in the following sense. Political appointments should be confined to the Vice-Presidency of the Assembly. Appointments to the posts both of Presidents and of Rapporteurs of Committees should be made solely for efficiency.
The SECRETARY GENERAL said that Professor Attolico’s view, though sound in theory, would be hard to realise. Representatives of the great Powers did not want to be Presidents of Committees and therefore they had to be Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. For the important representatives of other Powers there remained therefore only the presidency of Committees which was, ip fact, more coveted for purposes of publicity than the Vice-Presidency of the Assembly.
Mr. do MApARiLxdA asked whether the important personages might not b$ appointed as Presidents of Committees on the understanding that they should not preside.
-4-
The SECRETaRY-GEIíEIíAL thought that it would damage the prestige of the League if Presidents of Committees only occasionally presided. The test solution seemed to him to lie in getting really competent rapporteurs. However, this matter could, not he usefully discussed, further as a general question.
5.	The SECRETARY GEEERAL asked whether the speech by the President of the Council would relate chiefly to the work of the League or to the future policy of Prance.
Mr. CCMEET replied that as far as he could tell the two subjects would be treated in the proportion of three to one.
6.	Mr. GILCHRIST asked whether, in view of the interest shown in the United States of America in the codification of international law the work that the League had done in this field might not be stressed both in the speech of the President of the Council and in the course of Assembly debatí.s.
The SECRETARY GEEERaL said this point should be
no te d»
7.	Mr. CQMERT explained the existing situation regarding the broadcasting of Assembly speeches. The Association of Journalists in Geneva showed an hostility which might be overcome. He did not think it certain that Reuters would be hostile.
The SECRETARY GETEFAL said that the question did not matter greatly if the broadcasting companies took full responsibility for what was done.
8.	The SECRETARY GETTER A L said that he had not much news concerning the Pact negotiations in Loudon further to what had appeared in the press. The only real difficulty/
-5-
appeared to be the finding- of a formula, for the -automatic operation of sanctions if flagrant cases of aggression arose. Under Articles 41 ana 42 of the Treaty of Versailles the Contracting Parties were entitled to regard as hostile a very wide category of possible acts by Germany in the demilitarised zone. In the Pact it was proposed that most of these possible acts should be regulated by the League procedure. Others it was considered, might be so flagrant a breach of the peace (e.g. an invasion by Germany of the demilitarised zone) that it would be unwise to await the summoning- of the Council and take the risk of the postponement of action owing to a failure to obtain unanimity. In such eases it was proposed that the parties to the Pact might act on their own initiative.
The most important immediate question seemed to be whether Germany would accept in principle the proposals made. In London it was considered unlikely th^t Germany would apply for membership of the league at the next Assembly, Nationalistic forces which might be embarrassed by Article 16 of the Covenant and pacific forces seemed to be very evenly balanced. It was thought that an application might be received in October or November.
9.	The SRCRLIARY GRNHRa.L said that in his opinion, the Mosul Report has been better received in London than had appeared in the press. It was less we 11 received at Angora. It was hoped that the Council would soon arrive at a decision and. that the decision would be accepted.
It might be dangerous if the question were not settled in September,
10.	Sir Arthur SAL'TCP. said that the Report of the Experts on Austria had arrived, but was not yet in its/
-6-
final forii. It was being sent Confidentially to the Members o f the A us tr ian G ommi t tee .
11.	Sir Herbert ÜÏÆLS reminded Directors that his Department was prepared to supply any information required on the present state of expenditure concerning their sections.
12.	lir. HAA.3 said that the recent meeting of the- Transit Committee had dealt with two questions of a rather more political hind than usually came before It» On one, the jurisidiction of the Danube Commission, it seemed that a satisfactory settlement would be reached. On the second, the condition of I feme 1, there was less room for optimism. The essential condition of progress was the immediate coming into force of the Memel Convention,
It was agreed that efforts should be renewed to ensure the.deposit of the ratifications of the Convention, which alone remained to be done to bring the Convention into force.
13.	Mr. HAAS having commented on the difficulty caused to the proceedings of Committees by the curiosity of tourists visiting the Secretariat, it was decided that Professor Attolico should reconsider che question of the conditions in which these visits should be allowed.
14.	nr. Homan WEITL said that there was to be held shortly a meeting of medical statisticians of unusual interest owing to the importance of the countries represented.
15.	Dame Rachel CP.O'ADY said that the Opium Advisory Committee would meet for the first time after the Opium Conference, on .August 24th. The United States was this time sending only an unofficial observer and not as formerly an unofficial observer
in a consultative capacity. It was said that China would not be represented. Switzerland would be represented.
-7
It appeared that a bock had boon written by the American Advisor to the Chinese Delegation to the Opium Conference, attacking the Secretariat for anti-American bias at the Conference and also for tampering with the Conference reports. The answer to the latter charge was of course tlm t reports were issued to the press of the verbatim record as soon as it was typed.
Tne am Cits TxihY-Ghhnrbiii asked Lir. Comert to note this and discuss with Mr. Cwectsor when he returned, the advisability of refuting, either by a short press notice, or better still in a review of the work in question, the allegations made.

Mr. Wilson (Secretary'!
l)B The mee ting, considered the list which had been distributed (Annex i) showing the order in which it was proposed that the items of the Agenda of the next Session of the Council might be discussed» Certain modifications were made which would be shown in the revised list to be distributed.
The following points were also raised
(a) The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Mosul question was placed first on the list , as the Council was meeting early to consider that question and would probably like to examine it first at any rate preliminarily«
(b} The SECRETARY-GEIh PAL said that items 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the list would presumably be submitted by the Council to the Assembly, without discussion.
(c)	Sir HERBERT AMES remarked that the Monad Case ¿id not appear on the Agenda. There was also the question whether the members of the tribunal in this case might not ask for honoraria
for their services
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the question of honoraria, if it arose, would he dealt with by the Council in the discussion of the Report which it would ultimately receive on the case. When this Report was received, the Monod Case could be treated as a sub-item of "general financial and administrative questions",
(d)	Mr, COL BAIT said that it would be convenient if one could be sure that no meeting of the Council would be held during the first week of the Assembly,
Lr, Van HAMEL thought that it would be wrong for the Council to moot while the Assembly was discussing the report on the work of the Council.
Professor ATTOLICO also thought that the Council should not meet while the important political discussions were taking place in the Assembly. If it was necessary for the Council to meet	then, the AssemblyTs	meetings ought	to be	interrupted.
It was agreed that	apart from the	Mosul	question, the
demands	of which on the time	of the Council	could	not be foretold,
it would be reasonable to expect the Council not to hold meetings in the first week of the Assembly, except on economic and financial subjects, though Tuesday afternoon should he kept free from a meeting of Assembly so that the Council might meet then.,
[e)	DAME RACHAEL CROEDY said that the Report of the Opium Advisory Committee should be ready for submission to the Council on about the 3rd September,
if) Mr, COLBAIJ said that the mandatories of the Council had asked for the postponement of item 20 on the list; a statemen to this effect should be mado at the first meeting when the agencl■ was discussed«,
(g) It was also agreed that the question of the demilitaris zone mentioned in a foot-note on the Council Agenda should be brought to the notice of the Council at its first meeting, so that it could decide whether to postpone it, or not.-
3
2) At the Secretary&Generalrs request M. MANTOUX aloud the Note which had teen prepared by the Committee by the last Directors1 Meeting to consider arrangements Assembly (Annex 2).
Besides certain modifications of the proposed ments which would be reproduced in a revised Note to be ted in due course.
The following further discussion of the note
read set up for the
arranse-dis tribu-
took place
In reply to Dr, Tan Hamel the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that a draft statement for the guidance of the President would be prepared, as on previous occasions.
Professor ATTODICO suggested that the two full days set apart for the discussion by the Assembly of the report on the work of the Council, should not be as now proposed, Wednesday and Thursday, but Friday and Saturday of the first week.
The continuous debate would then be better prepared and more concentrated.
After some discussion on this proposal and especially on the bearing which its adoption would have on the meetings of the Assembly Committees, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he preferred to retain that passage of the Note as it was. The Bureau of the Assembly would of course modify the proposed arrangements-if the debate on the work of the Council seemed to require it.
(Seances des Commissions) Mr. WALTERS gave the following explanations with regard to paragraph II of that heading:-
The arrangements proposed referred to that period, usually in the second week of the Assembly, when there was nothing but meetings of Commissions. Experience had shown that it was undesirable for a Commission to meet in the afternoon and again on the following morning. For this period
4
therefore it was proposed that one set of Commissions should meet always in the afternoon and another set always in the morning* Of the possible arrangements, the balance of advantages seemed td incline towards this*
The SECRETARY-GENERAI agreed, adding that the least employed Commissions should meet in the mornings
Division of questions on _the Agenda be ivre en the Comm is s ions , In reply to M. MADARIAGA it was agreed that it would be advisable if the Assembly formally referred to the 'Ehird Commission, any armaments question treated in the report on the work of the Council on which it required discussion.,
Dm YAK BAME1 referred to the disadvantages which at the last Assembly had resulted from the simultaneous reference to Commissions 1 and 3, of the questions which formed the subject of the Protocole He suggested that the Third Commission might be made a Specialists1 Commission for all this class of subjects at this Assembly. It could refer to the First Commission any specifically legal questions,
M. MADARIAGA explained how the subjects of the Protocol, though logically they seemed to relate more closely to the arbitration than to the disarmament werh of the League, had in fact proceeded from the Leaguels examination of disarmament question and so had been treated principally by the Third Commission.
Drc YAK HAMEL hoped that there would he no automatic division of these subjects between the two Commissions, as last year,
TIjo DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL observed that the members of tho Delegations had probably been already chosen with such a distribution in view«,
- 0 -
Professor ATTOLTCO thought the decision of this question should depend on which method would give the test results, end thet would depend on whether it was found opportune a at this Assembly to stress arbitration rather than disarmament, or vice versa,.
It was finally agreod that I*cm ho.15 on the Note shoald_ be taken away from the Third Oomnlission and reserved, and that the President of the Assembly might state that he would wait to make proposals with regard to this item till after the general debate had taken ¡.lace and after consultation with the Bureau,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL raised the point whether Item 19 (Report of the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation) and Items 10 and 11 (instruction of Youth in League Questions) should bo referred to the Second or Fifth Commission,
Dr. FIT032 said that at the last Assembly, Intellectual Co-operation had been satisfactorily dealt with by the Second Commission, which ho thought should deal with it again,
Instruction of Youth Questions was a rather different problem; Dame Rachel Crowdy had pointed out that the Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People was interesting itsolf from its own point of viow in those questions, but even so he thought that essentially these questions wore of a different nature from those considered by the Committee for the Protection of Children and so by the Fifth Commission.
There followed a rapid exchange of views on this point.- The DEPUTY SECRETAFY-GENERAL said that the Committee for the Protection of Children dealt only with the civil and penal aspect of that problem: DAME RACHEL CE01?rDY said that the Committee thought that it did not : The DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL averred that in any case the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation was f. technical organisation which the SECRETARY-
6
GENERAL questioned: Sir AFUiuJE SALTER said that it was roughly true that the work of the Second Commission concerned the "normal" fi.e. the decently prosperous and reasonably middle-aged) human-being: the Fifth Commission, the "abnormal": DAME RACHEL CROY'DY quoted a text of the Committee for the Protection of Children, saying that the Committee dealt with the "normal" child: Dr, YAH HAMEL wondered whether the interests of the instruction of youth would ho safe in the hands of the "normal" hankers and transportsers of the Second Commission:
Sir ARTHUR SALTER said that the Second Commission was not composed only of such : Mr, COLEAIv and Mr. CUMMIITOS thought that education questions wore not "humanitarian" questions; they
were practically political questions and -would be safer with the 2nd Commission! Mr, HAAS said that If practical results were wanted in those education questions, they could only be achieved by the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation, and that therefore the subject should go to the Second Commissions Professor ATPOIl'CC said that the consequence of Mr, Faosrs assumptions would be to give no serious work to the Fifth
Commission, and DAMS RACHEL CROÏÏDY agreed that it would then be harder than ever to koep ulta enthusiasts off that Commission, Che SECRETARY-GENERA! said that in view of Dr. Nitobe*s views Item 19 should go to the Second Commission, and, on the whole, he preferred to leave Items 10 ana 11 where they were in the Note. The distribution of items amongst Commissions was not supposed to follow hard and fast rules, but should be
decided by circumstances which/
- 7 ~
would "be appreciated only when the Assembly mete It would be convenient if Commissions 2 and 5 were largely composed of the same delegates» Perhaps a Mixed Committee of the too Commissions might consider Items 10 and 11„
In reply to Dr, YAH HAMEL the S EGRET AS Y - ■ GENERAL said that if MIL de Montenach and V/ilson were, as proposed* appointed Secretaries of the President and the Bureau of the Assembly, relations with the President of the Assembly would be concentrated in LI. de Montenach-s hands* as senior,
(h) Sir HERBERT AMES said, that if the person they wero all thinking of were appointed president of the Assembly, he would probably not bring stenographers; he and his secretaries should therefore be provided with the help required*,
Professor Aal'OIJ.CO agreed,
The SEOEEPAiTf GMlERZui referred to a proposal by Ms Comert that the resume of Press opinion should, at this Assembly, again be prepared for distribution to delegates. This had been discontinued at the last Assembly, but had been done at the Assemblies before,
Mr, CUMMINGS explained that the distribution of this .resume had teen discontinued at the last Assembly, on the ground that if it were to be a real reflection of what the world was saying about tha Assembly, it would have to he frank and might occasionally be thought to be offensive. On the other hand, an inoffensive selection of news could be prepared, but it would probably not be representative,, However, protests against the stoppage of this circulation had been ms.de last year even in the Assembly itself; it was therefore proposed to continue it.
8 -
Six ARTHUR SALTER' emphasised strongly the use of such a rdsum^ at any League Assembly or General Conference»
Sir HERBERT AMES said that some delegates had complained of the number of papers they received, and the cost which this entailed to the League,
Professor ATTOLICO thought that the rdsume was useful if the atmosphere of the Assembly was quiet, but if stormy, harmful.
In reply to a suggestion by UL MADARIAGA it was agreed that the resumd, if proposed at all, should be prepared by the Secretariat on its own responsibility, and not covered by the responsibility of the Journalists5 Association of Geneva»
The DEPUTY SECRETARY“GENERAL thought that if it were decided to issue a summary it should be prepared by trained persons in the Information Section»
The SECRETARY-GEHERAL concluded that the difficulties might be met if« instead cf circulating the resume automatically, a note were sent out to the delegates reminding them that this resume was prepared by the Secretariat for its own use,, explaining the limits within which the Secretariat was responsible for it, and offering it to delegates which ashed to receive it» Though the rOsumd would be given to journalists, it would not be marked as prepared for journalists»
The DEPUTY SECRETARY--CEHERAL said that this solution had the advantage of making the Secretariat appear to do the Delegations a favour, rather than to attempt to influence their views»
The SECRETAHY-GEEERAi. suggested that any Sab--Committees set up by Assembly Commissions should, in future, have some
designation, e* g* >T
Building Sub-Oommittee. -T
9
VI,	in reply to M* Madarifcga the SECRETARY •‘GENERAL said
that it was no more known than at the last Directors1 Meeting, who would be the Presidents of the Assembly Commissions.
Mr, C0L3A1? thought it would bo very useful if Members of the Secretariat could honestly say that there existed no Secretariat list of the Presidents of Commissions, even an unwritten list.
yil.	The SECRETARY-GEhERAJj said that M, Haas had suggested
that League Missions, while on International waters, should bo able to fly a League ” pavilion ”, Perhaps the question might be raised by 3ome Member of the Second Commission.
Professor ATTOLICO said that there was no real necessity for such a flag, even though, as was stated, it was not to be a general League flag, but simply a " pavilion distinctif” to be used by Missions of the League in certain circumstances. Onco such an emblem wore adopted there would be no controlling its use aad inevitably it would be said ."here is the Super State”,
M, HAAS still considered that it was necessary for quite technical and practical reasons. He explained the difficulties which his absence had caused-.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER suggested that if it were merely an administrative question it would be better for it to bo raised In the Council than at the Assembly, If it were raised in the Assembly it would, be difficult to avoid giving the matter publicity, and possibly holding a competition of designs.
Dr. VAN HAMEL confessed to doubt about the need
to have a flag.
- 10
Hr» GOXB/ili also thought it unnecessary.
Professor ATTOLICG suggested that if it were really required it could he invented on the spot and used by the Mission concerned and nothing said about it.
Mr» HAAS then asked whether it would be taken that the Transit Committee could deal with the matter on its own responsibility»
Professor ATTOli-lCO thought that it would be better to leave matters as they were now. The Secretary-General generally agreed and decided to drop the subject as a possible item for action by the Assembly or Council,

Pour les questions intéressant particulièrement une Section, cette Section prêtera sa collaboration à 1Tétablissement des procès-verbeux.
Un outre, un Document Officer devra être désigné par le Secrétaire de la Commission.
1.31 » de Montenuch et Wilson pourraient être chargés des fonctions de secrétaire du Président et du Bureau de 1’assemblée0 La désignation définitive s’effectuera après-11 élection du Président, Les Sections nç doivent pas compter su.r le service des précis-writers pour l’établissement d’aucun procès-verbal des séances des commissions consultatives qui pourraient être tenues pendant la durée do l’Assemblée; elles auront à assurer elles-mêmes la rédaction des proces-verbaux de ces séances,
M. Huston,, les Secrétaires des Commissions, les chefs des Services administratifs^. régleront ensemble toute question de matériel ou de personnel qui pourrait se poser..

Rien ne sera changé aux diverses publications éditées par le Secrétariat pendant ^assemblée (Journal de l’Assemblée comprenant des résumés très brefs établis pur le Secrétariat sans être soumis aux Délégués ayant pris part aux débats, et n’ ayant aticun caractère officiel. - Comptes-rendus in extenso des séances plénières). Les procès-verbaux des Commissions seront publiés seulement après l’Assemblée. Pour éviter certaines observations sur los procès verbaux des Commissions, peut-être conviendrait-il de rappeler les conditions dons lesquelles le texte définitif de ces procès-verbaux sera établi. A cet effet, le Secrétaire général pourrait, comme l’année dernière, adresser une note.au Bureau de 1 »-.assemblée. Après examen par le Bureau, cette note serait transmise par lui aux présidents des Commissions, qui en donneraient lecture à cheque Commission.
(Le texte de la note-adressée l'année dernière aux présidents des Commissions se trouvée dans le Journal Officiel, supplément spécial 11° 28, pages 9-10).
Les Secrétaires des Commissions devront indiquer clairement, aussitôt que possible, aux Commissions, los documents qui sont mis à leur disposition et qui contiennent les éléments d’information sur les points qu'elles auront à discuter. Ils devront s’efforcer do régler, autant que possible d’avance, la marche du travail de leurs Commissions ot l'ordre dons lequel les questions diverses seront abordées, de façon à éviter toute perte do temps,
Afin d’assurer l'unité du travail entre les différentes Commissions une réunion des Secrétaires de Commission aura lieu chaque jour dans le bureau du Secrétaire général adjoint avant la séance de l’Assemblée’, do façop. que le Secrétaire Général puisse être tenu quotidiennement au courant du progrès des discussions ot régler en conséquence l’ordre du jour dc-s séances de l’Assemblée.

Directors* Meeting 146. ERRATUM.
MINUTES OF DIRECTORS»MEETING,
ERRATUM.
The following statement is circulated with reference to the Minutes of the Directors1 Meeting of August 26th 1925. (No.146)
I have read through the Minutes of the Directors1 Meeting which was held oh August 26th. I. am afraid that m7 point of view does not come out at all clearly on page 5 when we were discussing what Committee should deal with Items 10 and 11 at the coming Assembly. My point was this, and this alone, that as there is the report #f the Child Welfare Committee to be considered by the Assembly and as in addition there is a report concerning Instruction of Children and Youth in the existence and aims of the League of Nations, those had much better be taken at the same Committeernot necessarily because the Commission for the Protection and Welfare of Children and Young People had any special right to deal with the additional question, but because confusion would be created in the minds of the Delegates to the Assembly, unless the same people dealt with the two subjects and were thereby able to realise that the subjects were not the same, but different l The point I also tried to emphasise was that in the Report of the Advisory Commission reference was made to the education of young people in the principles of international oo-operation and the fact was recorded that the Commission attached great
— 2 ^
importance “to this question and was glad to note that a report on the subject was to be brought before the Vlth Assembly. To my mind therefore it will be difficult to explain both to the Vth Committee and to the Advisory Commission why this report should be considered at a different time and by a separate Assembly Committee.
The last paragraph on page 5 should also read; "The Deputy Secretary-General said that he understood that
the Committee"..........."Mfcffi RACHEL CROWDY said that this
was not the case".

1,	The SBCBDIVilIY-GBHERA1 Bald that ho thought the decision of tho Assembly to end the sossion when it did was on tho ono side \;nfo rtnnato, as somo qnoations wore thorohy considered too summarily, hut on tho other perhaps certain political advantages worn gained.
The secretarial arrangements made for tho AsEnmbly had boon hotter th n tho previous year.
2.	Concoming tho C0nforcnco at Locarno he know nothing of importance beyond what had appeared in tho Press, Ho hod bean struck by tho groat emphasis laid by
II. Doliiuhcrin on Article 1G of tho Covenant. It upposred that Ii, Pchichorin had said that the acceptance by
2
Gorman7 of Article 16 would to a factor tolling for war, or words to that offset. Since .Article 16 was dangerous only tc States which made unprovoked attacks on other States, ono could hardly resist tho conclusion that Russia might do intending, in certain circumstances, an unprovoked attack upon its neighbours. The Information Section should take my suitable occasion of orplaining the real hearing of Article 16.
3.	Before the ne:ct sossion cf the Council tho only
work relating to questions of major importance devolving on the Secretariat appeared to ho that connocted with the preparations for tho Economic Conforonoo find for the reduction of armaments.
Tho Mosul question would not touch the Secretariat again until the Court had given its decision. It was greatly to be hoped that the Court would confine its answers to the dofinito questions before it and would not give oictonsivo interpretations of tho Covenant. Tho imprecision of certain articles of the Covenant hod been useful to the Council in the settlement of certain disputes. Ho was afraid that if successive interpretations by the C0urt removed this vagueness the Covenant might become as rigid as tho Constitution of tho Lnitod States of America.
In reply to II. COLBAN, the liBCRBTAKY-GEITEEAL said that he did not crepect to bo represented on the Court in tho hearing of the Mosul case, but of course he would send replies to any spocifio questions addressed to him by the Court. There had already been prepared for the use of the Court by the Legal Section a list showing the procedure adopted by the Council in each dispute which had come before it.
not fully
Dr» von HALEL sold that this list was onplanatory and it was possible the.c the Court wonId bo well advised to put carts in questions to tho kocrotary-G-onaral.
The SECHEfArA-C3TTE Ah saia that ho wou Id he prepared to answer only questions of facts?- he would on no account consent to give opinions to tho Court.
Hr. ran IIALIHL was afraid that the Court, por-hape involuntarily, v/cnld q±o statements hanpr ring tho future froo&em of tho Councils Ho called attention to the fact that a statement issued by the President of the Court virtually invi ted, Lumbers of the League otlior than tho two parties to the IIosu 1 disputo to presont observations on League procedure. It might ho that certain Htates, for instance those having obligations under tho ilinoritios treaties, might avail themselves of this opportunity *
I.!.- CGLEAN hoped that members of tho Secretariat would do everything in their power to prevent this happening c If tho Court gave opinions on League procedure in general, tho result might he, fer instance, to dostroy tho advisory opinion procedure*
I! o I.L42TTOIX ohsorv od thr. t the IIosu 1 qu os tion required tho interpretation not of the Covenant of the League hut of paragraph 2 of Article 3 of tho Ereeth of Lausanne and its consequence's.,
2ho SEGUE jABY-GEHEIvAL said that the Court would also have to consider how far the promises made hy tho two parties before tho Council wore binding.
Dr. Van HAL EIL said that tho furbish Government had sent copios of tho Red Booh to the Court.
- 4
4*	H* HAIT fOUJC said that pro parrot ions wore be ing a&do
for the Commission appointed by the Council of the Lcaguo to proceed to the Errs cols Lino as coon as possibles,
5a	Mi If'lTfCOI, reverting to the remarks of the
Secretary-General on Article 16, said that thoro wore indications in the Ar°ss that Germany wished to define "aggression" as applying not only, or necessarily, to the taking up of arms but aLso to ether measures, for instance, economic moasuroo which might justify an opponont in resorting to arras in his own defence . Phis was a revival of the old encirclement theory. Tno question would probably bo d’iscussed at Locarno.
Phe QllCKIiPAI :Y-0!3IERAL said that if a State put pressure on another State by economic or othor means, the dispute could go to the Council under Article 15. Interpretations of agression such as that attributed to Germany could not affect the obligation on States to wait throe months after the Council^ ioport had been published before taking up arms, nor did they afzoct the provisions of irticlo 16 whore the expression used was "resort to war", that iss, take
up arms .
M, do LL'QiiiilAGA said that .the discussions of the Pormn.no nt .Advisory Commissi on on aggression showed how divided opinions wore on the criteria of aggression.	I1 ho remedy
was to aecopt the' principles of the Protocol and relate aggression to tho refusal to submit to arbitration.
II*' IIAITHOUA said that in the series of possible acts of an increasingly aggrossivo naturo a line of demarcation should bo fixed boyond which such acts should bo considered definitely as aggression. It was hard .to say where this lino Qould bo placed oxueet at the point whore a btato actually resorted to violence

6.	Dr. van H/&IBL said, that ho had boon asked by
Professor Attclico to raise the question whether tho meeting hold "by the Council immediately after the close of tho Assembly’s session should not ho private. The recent Lithuanian incident seemed to show that this was desirable. For this last mooting the Council could not prepare itself as thoroughly as for other mootings and its proceedings were* therefore subject to incidents and surprises. Tho question of tho procedure to be adopted in the ease of petitions arising cut of tho Momcl Convention, out of which the Lithuanian incident had arisen, should have boon dealt with in private end without the Lithuanian representative being there.
The GE GRETAW-GEWUlAL felt strongly that it would bo a mistakes for a mooting of the Council which was almost entirely devoted to liquidating tho affairs of tho Assembly to be held in privates. An unpleasant contrast would then bo made between the opennoss of tho Assembly's and the secrecy of the Council's proceedings. Questions which wore not of urgent or public interest might bo postponed tc tho Docombor session of the Council, and this method might perhaps hav o been appliod to the Homo 1 question.
As to tho right of the Lithuanian representative to be present at the meeting of the Council in question, it should bo remembered that in any ease Lithuania had to bo invited while tho part of the RGpo rt regarding tho minorities procedure under tho Convention was discussed. As for that part of tho Report out of which the incident had arisen, namely, tho procedure relative to general petitions, his view had been that it was politically right,and oven legally necessary,for the Lithuanian ropre sontativo to he invited and to give the Council his views on tho procedure.
-6«
Tho report mentioned two alternatives and to adept for general petitions tho minorities prcoodur© surely necessitated the presence of the Lithuanian representative.
M. COIBaI? said that the position was similar to that when, on tho report on donator Tittoni, the Council has adopted its first minorities procedure. It was in order to avoid oomplaints by Lithuania that djts Government had boon invited to bo represented.
Dr. van KuLiEL asked whether there was any likelihood that tho Secretary-General would be consulted before tho Locarno Conference drafted olauses in tho proposed paot placing obligations on tho Council of the League.
The SECEETiiEY-GBKEEilL said that he did net know of any suoh likelihood.
Dr. van HAMEL expressed his regrets. The representatives of individual governments could not bo depended on, as could the Sooretary-Genoral, to understand clearly tho way in which * the League worked, not to speak of tho general interests of the League.,' The result would very likely bo that as in Artiolo 3 of tho Droaty of Lausanne the Conference would attempt to escape from -a difficulty by using tho mystical formula of "reference to tho Council of tho League” without clear definition of what the Counoil was called upon to do. Theoretically, of course, tho Council oould refuco to accept work so placed on it but in fact it could not*
The SECREiYiRY-GENERAL said that from assurances he had received ho felt confident that‘tho proposed Pact would not contain anything contrary to the lottor or spirit of the Covenant. It was truo that tho Pact would probably place additional duties on tho League, but he did not think that those would in any case exceed tho
• V-
dutics which tho league would hayo assumed under Ho was not altogether convinced by Hr * van Hamel1
tho Pro teco s reference
to
the- Mosul dispute» VThon this matter first came before the Council, the Council made it Clear that it reserved the question
whether it would, accopt the duties laid upon it by the Treaty
of Lausanne until it obtained an assurance - as in September 1924 it thought it had obtained - that the parties uooeptod* and were agreod as to tho nature of its competence.. It could hardly have foreseen tho misunderstandings which had since urison. The Council was in foot always able, before accepting a task placed upon it by treaties* both to define that task and to lay down the conditions under which it Wóuld accept iti
Mi MhHTOUX reminded the mooting that in the Piccadilly days of the League allied representatives negotiating tho Treaty of Sevres had boon astonished when it had been represented to
them that the Council might not automatically accept certain duties which it was proposed that that Treaty should lay on it,
M. COLBAH said that in every case tho Council, before taking up duties placed upon it by treaties, had taken a formal decision to accept these duties.	However, ho agreed so far with
Pro van Hamel that if any request came from loourno for the 3eoretary~GeneralTs advice on certain points he hoped that this request would bo met. Ho was not greatly frightened by tho possibility that the Conference might escape present difficulties by casting them upon the League. The longue was there to boar burdens of that kind.
Dr» van EaLIEL said that ho thought there Was a prospect of real harm being done to tho League through the adaption of vague formulao designed to postpone troublesome decisions.
-^8
The SECRETARY GENERAL said that if any serious difficulty of the hind arose at the Conference it was very probable that he would be consulted, but he was not prepared to tako any initiative himself in the matter.
8.	Mt COMEET said that he had ascertained in Paris that opinion was on the whole favourable to action being taken on
the Chilean resolution for the convocation of a Press Conference. In November a European Press Conference would bo hold at Rome and more would then be known concerning the possibilities of acting on the Chilean resolution.
His impression at Paris had also boon that the work of the last session of the Assembly, however unsatisfactory it may have appeared at the timet was looking bettor at a distance.
Also he was convinced that if the Lithuanian incident had occurred in a secret session of the Counoil there would have been much more comment on it.
9.	M. COMERT said that he had recaived from M. Colban a noto reoommending extreme caution by members of his section in any relations they might have with members of the Minorities Congress which was to open in Geneva on October 14th. He thought that all Directors should know of this Congress, and asked M. Colban to speak of it.
M. COLBAN explained that the Congress would consist of minority loaders in the various countries. Its programme appeared harmless, but the very fact that an international minorities congress was being held in Geneva would cause oertain apprehensions. His instructions 1» his own Section has been that they should refuse to discuss with voproseniatives of the Congress any question relating to minorities.
i
"9>-
The SECRETARY GEEERAL hoped that Directors would note what M. Golban has said. In his view tho Minorities which attended such a Conference showed doubtful loyalty towards their new countries.
Sir Herbert jlMSS said that the staff cf the Internal Control Department would bo changed this month and ho »ofcod
Directors to doal gontly with it for a wldle0
Sir Herbert MMB3 said that ho would shortly send to all Directois statements of the expenditure incurred by the various Sections in tho first nine months of tho year.
Sir Herbert JlLIES said it world bo useful if tho Committee on the new building- which was to meet on December 15th, could rc-pcr- to tho Council before the end of its December session,
The SECRETARY GEHERN said that ho
thought
tho Committee
had certain powers of decision itselfc If, however, tho authority ox the Council was required it might be delegated to tho President and rapport our „
M, C-DXBA1I hoped that the Secretariat of the Committee on the building could bo properly organised.. It was ossential that the committee should have all tho technical advice necessarya
There v/as some discussion c.n the respective func tior.s of the Commit+e e its elf and the Supervisory Commission as rc . ords the decisions to be t-uksru The SECRET. ,RY GEIER AI asked Dr. van Hama 1 t o re port to him o n_ thi s _sub ,|e o t,
M, ROUE IK said th-.-t from the meeting of the Passport Sub-Committee which had just been held in Paris it appeared that there was some hopo of abolishing the transit visa but no prospect of general abolition of passports or visas at present.
•The SECRETARY GBSERAI ashed the Information Section to see to it that the League got all possible credit for anything it did to simplify the passport system.
-10-
14.	M. G0LHA1I suggested that if anyone said that the minorities prooeduro of the league did net work he should ho told that this was not true, hs evidenoe of the activity of the Council and its minorities committees he would mention the treatment of the question cf the Hungarian optants in Rounanius the Lithuanian minorities problem and the two questions which hed been placed
on the agenda of the next session of the Council - the Turkish-ilrmonian problem and the very important problem of the "Humerus-Claususri in Hungary«,
15,	Hr. RhdCEMAH said that the Health Committee of the League
was in session and that the following questions of general
interest arose:
l) The proposal of M, Bumeta that Bureaux might bo established
in national health administrations tc maintain liaison Health Organisation of the Leagueas was already done Chechoslovakia and Hungary« He would like the advieo Secretary-Gonorsl and his colleagues on this point,
She SECRETARY GEhlHRAL thought that if the Health considered the establishment of such liaison useful it
with the in
cf the
Committee
should
say that it would be happy to co-operate with any bureau of the kind proposed which a government thought fit to create and should then explain what form this co-operation could take,
2) Hr., KAJCHMAN said that a Conference on ,rMc die aments h£roiqucs'r recently convoked by the Belgian Government at Brussels had rceoroonded the establishment of an international pharmaoopoic secretariate The British and Batch delegates had opposed the
establishment ox a now organisation of this kind outside thé League. The final decision had been to request the Belgian Government to ask the Council how collahoration with the League of Mations in this matter could be ensured and that meantime
-li-
the Belgian Administration should perform tho duties of the international secretariat.
This raised the question of article 24 of the Covenant. The present session of the Health Committee would probably wish to discuss the matter, us certain of its members were at the Brussels Conference.
Tho SECRETARY GENERAL thought that if the question wore raised at the present session of the Health Committee it should bo ruled out of order. The first stop was for tho Belgian Government to approach the Council. The Health Committee would be seised of the question only when referred to it by the Council.

LE SECHE FAI HE GEE3RA1 de si re at tirer 11 a i tention du Comité des Pirecteurs sur la procédure à suivre pour l’admission de l’Allemagne dans la Société des Hâtions à la suite des accords de Locarno. Il sera certainement nécessaire de convoquer une session spéciale de l’Assemblée, soit en vertu d’une décision
r
du Conseil prise à la majorité, soit A la suite do la demande d’un Membre de la Sociétés demande qui devrait être approuvée dans un délai d’un mois par la majorité des autres Membres.
La convocation par le Conseil est donc la méthode la plus simple; aucun délai n’est prévu par le Règlement encre la décision et la réunion de l’Assemblée extraordinaire; mais, par analogie avec la seconde méthode de convocation, en pourrait envisager une réunion au bout d’un mois.
Puisqu’il a été décidé que la signature définitive des Fruités de Locarno n’interviendrait que le 1er décembre,
2
le Secrétaire Général qui avait cl1 abord envisagé une réunion formelle du Conseil pour le 20 novembre, et une réunion de l'Assemblée pendant la, session du Conseil do Décembre, croit que le "onseil du 7 décembre pourrait être saisi de la demande de 1'Allemagne et donvaquer l'Assemblée pour la seconde moitié de janvier par exemple0
Il sera nécessaire d'examiner, au cours de cette Assemblée spéciale, non seulement l'admission de l'Allemagne
dans la Société des Nations, mais aussi son entrée comme membre permanent du Conseil, éventuellement l'entrée au Conseil des pays qui demanderaient à être membres permanents, et un certain nombre de questions budgétaires, telles que la fixation de la contribution de 1’Allemagne, l'ouverture de nouveaux crédits pour ¡5ernetfre à l'Allemagne d'être immédiatement représentée au Secrétariat, etc«
L'interprétation de l’art, lo du Pacte qui a été donnée à Locarno n'aura sans doute pas à être évoquée avant l'Assemblée ordinaire de 192G, k moins que les Allemands ne désirent soulever immédiatement lo, question. Quelques problèmes juridiques subsidiaires pourraient également se poser k propos des tâches confiées au Conseil par les traités de Locarno. La Section juridique pourrait en entreprendre l’étude, mais il est évident quTil appartiendja^urtout * ux Membres du,Conseil d’exposer è. la prochaine Assemblée les effets du Pacte par rapport à la Société des
Nations
Mo MADAHIÀGA soulève la que

tion de savoir quand sera a donner son avis? confor-
mément. ' l'arto lu du Pacte, sur obligations militaires résultant
l’exécution par l'Allemagne des du Traité de Versailles«,
A3J2AHAII rappelle que? pour la Bulgarie et pour
3
l’Autriche, la C<,IJ0Ca s’est contentée cL 'enregistrer l’opinion du Comité militaire interallié constatant que ces pays avaient conformément à l’arto 1 du Pacte, accepté le règlement établi par la Société en ce qui concerne leurs forces et leurs armements i. -itaires, navals et aériens.,
LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL croit qu’on doit réserver cette question jusqu’au prochain Conseil; il estime que la C„PcC. devrait en tout cas siéger en même temps que l’Assemblée spéciale*
En réponse à une observation de 1 ■ «, Von HAMEL attirant l’attention sur i’artoD et sur la nécessité de ne pas créer de précédent qui pourrait êtro appliqué ultérieurement à la Turquie et à la Russie, le Secrétaire général estime que les questi ons sont différentes car, dans le cas do ces pays, il n’y a pas de limitation des armements résultant d’un traité»
Mo ABRÀHAII demande si les instructions données par les
Membres de la Société
à leurs délégués à l’Assemblée spéciale
seront limitées au problème de l’admission de l'Allemagne dans la Société, ou pourront être plus étendues.
T. V
lJ C_i
secr:
iTAIRE GESIER AI estime qu
’ elles
devraient également
leur permettre de prendre position sur la question de l’admission d c l’Allemagne au Conseil * Il devra donc être fait allusion à ce sujet dans l’ordre du jour de l’Assemblée que fixera le Conseil i.c décembre. Comme il ne sera pas possible de mentionner alors expressément l’admission de 1’Allemagne au Conseil, puisqu’elle ne sera pas encore membre de la Société, on pourrait signaler, dans l'ordre du jour, l’application éventuelle du second paragraphe de l’art04 du Pacte,, Ce roxte couvrirait non seulement la désignation de .l’Allemagne comme membre permanent du Conseil, mais éventuellement celles du Brésil, de l’Espagne et de la Pologne, si ces Etats désiraient poser leur candidature »
~ 4 -
5c	En réponse à Sii HERBERT :-îJj , qui a vu dans ia
presse certaines informations suivant lesquelles le Mexique
\
serait disposé à faire une demande d'entrée dans la Société des Hâtions, le SECRETAIRE IME?1I dit que cette demande pourrait être étudiée par l'Assemblée spéciale, de même que celle de lo Turquie, si elle se produisait après le règlement du problème de Lossoul.
En réponse à une autre question de Six HERBERT \LE3, le SECRETAIRE GM ERAL dit que la prochaine réunion du Conseil lui paraît devoir durer une dizaine de jours; elle pourrait donc être saisie, après le 15 décembre, d'un rapport sur les offres éventuelles d'achat du bâtiment actuel du Secrétariat qui auraient été faites d'ici cette date.
7«	Six ARTHUR SAUTEE remarque que l'exposé du Secrétaire
Général suppose qu'entre le 1er décembre, date de la signature, et le 7 décembre, date de la réunion du Conseil, les ^coords de Locarno auront pu être ratifiés par les Parlements O
Le SECRETAIRE G EU EPA U ne croit pas, comme L Von Eamel, oue la ratification puisse intervenir avant le 1er décembre. Cette date lui paraît celle de la signature formelle et non pas seulement de l'échange des ratifications. Lais il espère que toutes les formalités intérieures pourront avoir été préparées en Novembre, si bien que lr demande d'admission de 1'Allemagne pourrait encore être reçue par le Conseil au cours de sa session de décembre, la ratification par le Reichstag ayant eu lieu au début du mois.
LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL a pris connaissance avec ëatisfaction de l'acte final de la Conférence de Locarno, dans lequel une allusion est faite aux travaux de la Société des dations à propos du désarmement. Il croit que, dans ces conditions, les Etats-Unis, se rendent compte que les Etats préfèrent agir par l'intermédiaire de la Société des Bâtions, ne convoqueront pas eux-mêmes de conférence du désarmement.
9.	Son attention a été attirée sur une nouvelle de la
presse d'aujourd'hui, annonçant des hostilités à la frontière gréco-bulgare. 11 est heureux d'apprendre qu'un télégramme de Londres annonce que cet incident est dès maintenant réglé.
10.	iL. iiAjJj RIEGa , après avoir montré les rapports qui
existent entre le traité de Locarno, le projet de Protocole et le projet de Pacte d'assistance mutuelle, indique qu'après l'entrée de l'Allemagne dans la. Société, il y aurait peut-être intérêt à inviter les Etats-Unis et la Russie à se faire représenter dans la Commission du Désarmement. Si ces Etats doivent prendre part à la grande Conférence, il serait bon qu'ils eussent participé aux discussions préparatoires. L'invitation pourrait être faite lors du Conseil de i,.ar s, ou même lors du Conseil spécial de Janvier, si l'on invite alors l'Allemagne à faire partie du Comité.
Le SECRETAIRE GENEE‘L préférerait aue.le Conseil spé cial de Janvier n'abordât pas déjà la ouestion de la représentation de l'Allemagne dans les diverses Commissions .
Il est vrai que l'Allemagne entrera automatiouement dans la C-.P.C. comme membre du Conseil; l'invitation aux autres Etats pourrait être faite àu mois de uais, si l'atmosphère
est favorable.
6
11.	¿1. Sv.'EEÏSER pense qu’il sciait peut-être utile poui
la Société des dations de publier le texte des accords de Locarno, en y joignant les décl rations des différents Ministères des Affaires Etrangères-
Le SECRETAIRE GENERAL croit que toute publication par la Société des nations avant la signature définitive, serait prématurée et pourrait entraîner des critiques; de meme que celles des différentes déclarations; la responsabilité de la traduction soulèverait d'ailleurs des difficultés.
12,.	Sir ARTHUR S^I/ÎER souhaite que la question des mesures
d'ordre de l'assemblée soit sérieusement étudiée asrent 1n prochaine réunion. Il faudrait, notamment, que l'interdiction faite au public d’applaudir fût effective. *eut~ être serait-il possible d'imprimer sur les cartes d'entrée que de telles manifestations sont défendues.
là.	M. ÈdEETSER désirerait que les voyages des différents
membres du Secrétariat fussent annoncés dans les Sections; il serait en effet possible d'utiliser ces déplacements dans l’intérêt général des affaires du Secrétariat, si l'Establishment Offioe ou les fonctionnaires eux-mêmes annonçaient à l'avance les voyages des membres du Secrétariat surtout dans les pays lointoins où. il n'existe pas de bureau permanent comme à Paris où à xondres,
14.	Il attire l'attention sur l’attitude américaine vis-à-vis du projet de codification du droit inter national.
15.	Sir HERBERT ARES rappelle qu’il n'a pas encore été possible d'entrer en rapport avec les représentants du Gouvernement suisse pour le règlement des questions financières en instance. Il espère que ces représentants viendront bientôt à Genève.
7
16»	En réponse à une demande de L, BQSTDïGr,
le dsSCRETAlRS GSEJER-AL ne croit pris que lie accords de Locarno puissent modifier profondément le statut, aarrois, lors de la prochaine réunion du Conseil, il sera possible de discuter la portée des engagements nui peuvent résulter des conversations qui ont eu lieu* Il ne penne pas qu'on puisse eller plus loin qu'inviter la Commission de Gouvernement à organiser quelque forme de représentation locale.
17«	DAME RàCIIEL CRQRDY expose l'état de la question armé-

Il comprend dès à présent Li. Nunsenj I.:, Fams et Sir Mac Donald Mais aucune nouvelle n'a encore été reçue do Rome ni de Berlin en ce qui concerne les représentants italien et allemand.
13.*	M, NITOBE annonce l'ouverture du nouvel Institut de
Coopération intellectuelle à Paris. Cent pièces sont en train d’etro aménagées au Palais Royal. Les chefs et sous-chefs de six départements ont été nommés et entreront en fonctions en novembre. Il annonce qu'en raison de la démission de 11. Bergs■-et de M, Ruffini, le Conseil devra élira deux nouveaux membres au Comité de Coopération intellectuelle. Le projet du Sénateur: Ruffini reste d'ailleurs en discussion.
19.	Mi. Van HAMEL attire l'attention sur l'importance du
Comité permanent de conciliation créé par les Accords de Locarno. Tous les conflits pour lesquels il n'est pas prévu de procédure spéciale de règlement (comme il est fait dans le plan Lav/es) seront soumis à cet organisme; la taebo de l'appareil juridique international a donc des chances de s'étendre d’un© façon importance»
Les parties ont accepté le principe du renvoi des lit ges devant le Comité permanent, l'une ou l'autre d’ontre elle.

pouvant soulever la question dans chaque cas déterminé. La création du Comité est une initiative allemande; il sera difficile de choisir ces membres permanents puisqu’ils doivent avoir deux tâches très diff¿rentes, agissant tantôt comme .juges, tantôt comme conciliateurs politiques * dans doute serait-il possible de remplacer les deux nationaux lorsque la question on discussion demandera des compétences techniques spéciales, mais non les trois antres membres ressortissants de tierces puissances.
Etant donné l’importance de la tache que peut avoir le Comité, il y aura certainement lieu de prévoir la constitution d’un secrétariat; celui-ci devra être très important, s’il n’9St pas fait appel aux organisations de la Société des Nations. Pour des raisons financières, cette collaboration apparaîtra sans doute comme la solution désirable; elle assurerait d’ailleurs au Comité permanent le bénéfice des organisations de la Société autres que le Service juridique3 Certains traités d’arbitrage (Norvège, Finlande) constituent un précédent, puisqu’ils prévoient appel au Secrétariat de la Société des Nations.
le SECRETAIRE GENERAL conçoit l’importance de cetto question, sur laquelle il compte attirer le moment venu, l’attention des Gouvernements intéressés.
M. Van HAMEL désire aussi faire remarquer l’influence que peut avoir sur le développement do la question européenne, l’accord de l’Allemagne et des Puissances alliées. Certains Etats d'importance secondaire, tout en se réjouissant do voir mettre fin à l'opposition existant jusque-là, pourront avoir l’impression que ce rétablissement du concert européen dos grandes Puissances, diminue leur rôle. Il conviendrait que le Secrétariat de la Société des Nations manifestât plus que jamais à nouveau son caractère international; il est en effet seul à représenter le principe fédéral, et son devoir est d’assurer à chaque Puissance

Après avoir rappelé l'heureux ré su 1 ta. t du Conseil tenu, la semaine dernière à Paris, le Secrétaire Général a fait ressortir que 1’intérêt de la question se concentre maintenant sur le travail de la Commission d'enquête. Il estime que cette Commission d'enquête est forte et bien composée; elle sera à Genève vendredi et, après avoir passé deux jours au Secrétariat, pourra probablement partir dimanche de Lausanne.
Son travail se divise en deux parties:
a)	Historique, responsabilités, indemnités s'il y a lieu,
b)	Mesures à prendre pour prévenir le retour d'incidents semblables à celui qui a provoqué la réunion du Conseil. À ce point se vue, en a envisagé plusieurs solutions; sons démilitarisée, création d'une Commission Permanente de Conciliation; mais ce ne sont là que des suggestions; ce sera à la Commission elle-même de se prononcer sur lesdites suggestions et d’en faire d’autres si elle le juge utile.
le 3ecré taire Général ajouta qu’il venait d’avoir une conversation avec le représentant de la Grèce auprès de la Société des Nations. Ce dernier lui avait montré un télégramme du Gouvernement grec annonçant ou’il était en faveur de toute méthode pour permettre de résoudre pacifiquement les conflits balkaniques. Le Gouvernement grec serait prêt à accepter l'arbitrage obligatoire ou tout autre système.
Ce télégramme se réfère d’autre part à la préparation -qui serait en cours au Secrétariat - d’un Pacte de garantie mutuelle pour les Balkans. Le Secrétaire Général a fait remarquer nu représentant de la. Grèce que c’était là une erreur complète et que le Secrétariat n’avait entrepris aucune étude de ce genre. Le Gouvernement grec ayant adressé le môme télégramme à ses représentants à Londres, Lome et Paris pour prouver ses dispositions pacifiques, il serait bon de faire savoir officieusement à ces trois Gouvernements que cette assertion du Gouvernement grec est complètement erronée.
Le Secrétaire Général, Li. Ave no1 et il. Catastini se chargent de faire le nécessaire à cet égard.
Il est à prévoir que la Commission d'enquête sera en état de faire son rapport au Conseil sur la première partie de son travail pour le mois-de décembre; il semble que la deuxième partie exige une étude plus complète et plus longue. Toutefois, c'est à la Commission seule qu'il appartiendra de décider ce qu'elle doit faire.
Le Secrétariat de la Commission sera assuré par le Lajor Abraham qui a traité la question à la Section Politique, le Capitaine Lathe net qui connaît la région frontière intéressée,
M. Pietrcmarchi qui s'occupera de tous les détails d'organisation et L. Cespedes qui sera personnellement attaché au Présider* t.
A propos de la dernière réunion du Conseil, le Dr. Yan Hamel désire mettre en lumière 4 résultats qui lui semblent particulière men t in t ér essants:
a)	Le Conseil a été convoqué sur l’initiative du Secrétaire Général, initiative qui non seulement fut approuvée par le Conseil mais dont ce dernier félicita hautement le Secrétaire General. L’existence d’une autorité impartiale et capable de faire jouer
le mécaniane de Ici Ligue en cas de conflits se trouve ainsi démontrée .
Le Secrétaire Général déclare que c’ost en effet lui qui a convoqué le Conseil; ce peint a été précisé dans la conversation que L. Ave no 1 eut à cette occasion avec le Président du Conseil. Le Secrétaire Général ajoute qu’il doit conserver la liberté d’apprécier si dans des cas analogues, il doit prendre immédiatement l’initiative de convoquer le Conseil ou agir autre-me n t.
b)	Le Conseil a eu l’occasion de se référer à l’article 10 du Pacte .
Jne discussion s’étant engagée dans le Comité des Directeurs à ce propos, l’avis général a été qu’à ce point de vue, il fallait surtout retenir la, jurisprudence établie, d’après laquelle, dans des cas de ce genre, le Conseil insisterait avant tout sur la nécessité d’interdire eu de faire cesser immédiatement toute violation du territoire des deux Pitats intéressés.
c)	Pour la première fois, le Conseil a eu à envisager l’éventualité d’une application de l’article 15. Le Dr. Yan Hamel à ce propos desire faire remarquer qu’une interprétation trop rigide
de la procédure prérue par cet article pourrait limiter la liberté d’action nu Conseil et qu’il y a intérêt à en appliquer les stipulations avec souplesse. Il aurait pu se faire par exemple qu’une démonstration navale effectuée par certaines Puissances à la demande du Conseil et appuyée diplomatiquement par cous les membre c
de la Société, fût jugée nécessaire avant toute mesure économique, ne serait-ce qu’en vue de l’action militaire qui aurait pu ?tre envisagée ultérieurement.
Sir Arthur Salter, le Secrétaire Général et K. Avenol sont plutôt d’avis que dans ce cas, la démonstration navale n’eût été que la préparation nécessaire rie mesures économiques à prendre, mesures qui engagent non pas seulement certains membres, mais tais les membres de la Société.
Le Secrétaire Général fait ressortir en outre que l’article 11 du Pacte donne à la Société des Nations un assez large pouvoir en ce qui concerne les mesures propres à sauvegarder efficacement la paix des nations, l’article 15 prévoyant d’autre part le cas où un membre de la Société recourt à 1 a gu e rre .
Les mesures prises en vertu de l’article 11 ne peuvent d’ailleurs, ainsi que le fait remarquer Sir Arthur Salter, avoir en rien Le caractère de mesures de guerre, liais, en résumé, le Conseil a une grande liberté d’action qui lui laisse la possibilité de choisir, suivant les cas concrets qui se presentent à lui, les méthodes les plus simples et les plus efficaces.
d)	Au point de vue de la procédure, le Conseil a admis la présence à une réunion privée des deux parties en cause et a tenu à ce qu’elles ne connussent pas ses résolutions uniquement à la séance publique. Le Dr. Yan Hamel estime que cette pratique est plus large que celle qu’on avait suivie auparavant et que, de la part du Conseil, cette courtoisie n’exclut pas la vigueur.
Il se demande s’il n’y aurait pas lieu d’en faire désormais une règle établi g.
Le Secrétaire General et U. Avenol sont d’avis qu’il
ne fait pas de règlementation trop précise. Il convient de s’inspirer clos circonstances. Dans la question de ko s s oui par
O
exemple, les membres du Conseil ont eu à se concerter en dehors des deux parties, bien que l'une d’elles fût membre per-ïïl v-nt. D'autre part, lors du dernier Conseil à Paris, le rapporteur, M. Chamberlain, a toujours conféré, à la suite des entretiens privés des membres du Conseil, avec les représentants de la Grèce e t de la Bulgarie et les a mis lu courant des travaux.
Li. Colban fait ressortir la valeur de cette dernière procédure, les discussions qui ont ainsi lieu entre le rapporteur et les parties intéressées permettant très souvent d'arriver à d'heureuses solutions de conciliation.
3.	On passe ensuite à l'étude de l'ordre du jour provi-
soire pour la session do décembre:
Sur le point K ° 1: "arbitrage , sécurité, désarmement", EM. Van Hamel, Madariaga et Buxton rédigeront un paragraphe supplémentaire relatif aux résolutions de la première Commission de l'Assemblée.
À propos de la Commission des Mandats, le Secrétaire Général expose qu'il croit utile d'accorder une rémunération spéciale aux membres de âa Commission, qui passent 30 ou 40 jours par an à Genève et sent obligés de consacrer chez eux un temps au moins égal à la lecture des dossiers et à la préparation des sessions de Genève. Cette Commission est dans une situation spéciale, ses membres ne peuvent pas Être payés par leurs Gouvernements; ils fonctionnent en tout temps en qualité d'assesseurs du Conseil et doivent, d'une façon permanente, être en mesure de lui donner leurs avis. Il est donc facile d'établir une distinction entre cette Commission et les autres Commissions de la Société et de justifier l'attribution à ses membres d'une indemnité basée sur le chiffre de l'indemnité quotidienne attribuée par la Société des Nations aux membres de ses divers organismes.
- 5 -
Au sujet de la Sarre, il est décide d’attendre la session mime du Conseil pour savoir si la question de la nomim tion des membres de la Commission devra être traitée en décembre ou, comme l’année dernière, en mars.
Il est possible aus^i que la question des troupes françaises soit ultérieurement inscrite à l’ordre du jour.
d„	3ir Herbert Âmes fait ressortir que les nominations de
personnel à l’intérieur du Secrétariat sont toujours faites en tenant compte d’une juste répartition des rationalisés et que, s’il y a des plaintes à ce sujet, elles sont sans fondement. la liste des nominations effectuées en It&ô en. est la preuve.
À propos du paragraphe relatif aux questions administratives et financières, M. îiadariaga signale qu’à son avis, il y aurait intérêt à renouveler les Commissions de Contrôle et de Répartition des Dépenses qui ont subi peu de modifications depuis leur création.
7.	Le Dr, Horman L'hite annonce que la contribution britannique de f 3000 pour la mission relative à la maladie du sommeil p eut être pratiqueraent ccnsi dé rée c omme acquise .
8.	Le Secrétaire Général annonce qu’il va envoyer une circulaire aux Directeurs pour leur demander de lui faire connaître les missions à l’étranger qu'ils confient au personnel placé sous leurs ordres. Bien entendu, ces missions doivent toujours être approuvées par les Directeurs, mais il y aurait intérêt à ce que le Secrétaire Général en fût informé aussitôt que possible et que les Directeurs eux-mêmes pussent s'appuyer sur lui s’ils avaient des difficultés dans la répartition des dites missions, par exemple pour des raisons de nationalité.

Le Secrétaire Général dit que 1Tévènement lo plus important depuis la dernière séance a été la réunion et le départ de la Commission envoyée par le Conseil sur la frontière bulgaro-grecque. Tous ses membres se sont montrés persuadés de 1T importii.noe de leur tache. La première partie de leur travail sera relativement facile car ils rencontreront à Belgrade où. ils s*arrètont d*abord, les attachés militaires qui se sont xendus sur les lieux au moment du conflit et qui leur transmettront tous les renseignements qu*lls ont recueillis. De Belgrade, la Commission gagnera la région où se sont produits les incidents; puis elle se rendra à. Sofia et à Athènes, sans qu*on sache encore par laquelle des deux capitales elle commencera.
La deuxième partie de sa tache sera plus difficile

Il est douteux. qu’elle puisse présenter au Conseil ses conclusions, tout au moins ses conclusions définitives» au oours do la session do décembre.
Il ost probable que la prochaine session du Conseil durera 10 jours. Son ordre du jour est très chargé; Conférence Economique, Conférence du Désarmement, constitution des organes préparatoires do ccs Conférences, affaire do Mossoul, rapport de la Commission bulgaro-greeque, question d’Autriche.
Il y a lieu d’avertir officieusement les membres du Conseil qu’ils s’attendent à rester ici plus d’une semaine.
En relation avec cotte session du Conseil, il y a lieu do trancher la question de savoir ai les communiqués seront désormais donnés simultanément en français et on anglais. Elle a été posée à la suite do certaines critiques - notamment du correspondant du Daily Tolegraph - contre la publication en français seulement du communiqué.
D’un autre coté, certains journalistes peuvent estimer qu’ils ont avantage à avoir le communiqué immédiatement on une seule langue et à ne pas encourir un délai supplémentaire pour l’avoir en deux. Ceux-là diront qu'on sacrifie l’information de presse à des/méthodes bureaucratiques. Il faut choisir entre ces deux difficultés.
M. Cornert déclare qu’il a ciiseuté la question avec sa section et avec certains de ses collègues. Sir Arthur Salter, au cours d’une do cos discussions, a fait ressortir un aspect do la question qui doit certainement être pris on considération avant tout autre; c’est le suivant ;
Tout le monde sait que les textes officiels do la Sooiété dos Dations sont publiés en français et on anglais. Il y a donc un inconvénient à co qu’un communiqué donné en langue anglaise dans des journaux ou dans des publications quelconques ne soit en réalité qu’une traduction faite par un journaliste d’un communiqué français.
3
Dette pratique mène à ce résultat que la teneur du communiqué peut
i
varier suivant les journaux. Il fautléviter et, pour cette raison, donner un texte officiel dans les deux langues.
LL Gomert déclare se rallier à oe point de vue. La discussion qui sTensuit donne l’oooasion de faire remarquer que ll inconvénient oi-dessus signalé n’est pas le même pour les autres langues que le français et l’anglais; on sait que dans ce cas les textes publiés par des journalistes ne sont que des traductions, soit du français, soit de l’anglais et des dlvergenoes de texte aTn y en a ne soulèvent pas les objections mises en lumière par Sir Arthur Salter.
Finalement, il est décidé que les communiqués seront désormais publiés simultanément en français et en anglais.
M. Madariaga signale que le numéro du Times arrivé
/
aujourd’hui à Genève a publié un compte-rendu du programme de travail que le Gouvernement français compte proposer au Comité du Conseil, pour la réduction et la limitation des armements. Mais, bien entendu, cette information n’a rien d’officiel et il convient d’attendre une notification du Gouvernement français pour en discuter.
Sir Arthur Salter soulève la question de la vente des publications de la Ligue. Il a eu connaissance de deux réclamations particulières contre le dépositaire de Londres. Il signale d’autre part, à titre d’exemple, quo les prix de certaines publications sont mal ajustés, celui du rapport Eist-luyton par exemple:
6/- pour une toute petite broohure0 Ces prix sont établis en fonction directe du prix de revient qui, parfois, dépend de certaines oireonstanoes dont il ost Impossible de tenir compte pour la vente: travail do nuit, nécessité d’imprimer rapidement en raison d’une réunion du Conseil ou d’un Comité, etc.
4
A oo propos., M. Gomert signale que lo tirage dos publications de la ligue ost souvent trop faible, oo qui oblige à vendre chaque exemplaire à un prix plus élevé.
lo Dr» Norman White signale la liaison qu’il y a entre oette question et cello do la distribution gratuit-. e II lui semble que dans certains cas, la distribution gratuite ost beaucoup trop large, Il est appuyé par Sir Arthur Salter» Ou dernier fait ressortir que par la distribution gratuite, on risque souvent d’envoyer des publications à dos gens qui ne les lisent pas, au lieu que ceux qui les aohètont sont vraiment décidés à sTen servir; d’où l’intérêt do faire au bosoin des réductions de prix; bien que la distribution gratuite dos publications de la LiguG, ainsi que le fait remarquer M» Mantoux, touche en général des milieux spécialement intéressés.
M. Oolban do son cêté estime qu'il y aurait peut-être-intérêt à renforcer au Secrétariat le service qui s’occupe des ventes de publications»
Sir Herbert Ames tient à déclarer que ledit service a toujours travaillé avec beaucoup de dévouement et qu'il a obtenu d’exoellents résultats: 3-a vente des publications est en progrès, surtout pour les sections qui produisent des travaux intéressant un assez largo public: questions économiques et financières, publications de la Section d’information, etc» Cette question a été étudiée très sérieusement à diverses reprises, soit par la Commission do Contrôle, soit par les fonctionnaires intéressés du Secretariat»
Do même les listes de distribution gratuite sont périodiquement ravisées»
Finalement, le Secrétaire général propose de constituer un Goraité chargé d’étudier la question on toute son ampleur.
Il comprendra lo Professeur Attolico, Président, Sir Herbert Ames,
H, Comert, M» Mantoux, Sir Arthur Salter, M,» Pelt sera
5
secrétaire du Comité dont les membres recevront, avant la première réunion, un dossier relatif à la question.
Iil. Comert signale que deux sections du Secrétariat ont récemment donné directement dos nouvelles à la presse.
Le Comité est d'accord que la Section ¿'Information ost seulo responsable pour la communication aux journalistes, de nouvelles intéressant la Société dos Nations, étant entendu que si lTun d'eux est spécialement intéressé à étudier une question dans le détail, lu Section d'information l'introduit auprès du ou des fonctionnaires compétents des autres sections du Secrétariat.
Sir Herbert Lmes u reçu le rapport du Controleur des comptes. Il en profite pour rappeler, après le controleur, que tout Directeur désirant engager une dépense autre- que les dépenses régulières prévues par le fonctionnement normal de sa
section doit : s'il s'agit d'une dépense qu'il peut décider
\
lui-même, en informer le Service financier; s'il s'agit d'une dépenses qui oxisre 1 'autorisation préalable du Secrétaire général ou du Secrétaire général adjoint, s'assurer l'autorisation nécessaire et prévenir le Service financier. Dans aucun eas les dépense de ce f?enre ne doivent être en^asréG? de telle sorte que le Service financier en soit prévenu seulement quand il est nécessaire de payer. Il
Il est maintenant certain que l'exercice en cours accusera un surnlus de recettes d'environ 1 million l/2 de francs, qui permettra d'engager la question des constructions prévues par l'assemblée, sans, faire appel à une contribution spéciale.
6
M. Mantoux signale que lu mission du Général Lai doner est arrivée le 26 à Mo seoui. Elle a fait savoir que les incidents de frontière simulés étaient de peu d'import un oe et que la question des déportations de populations upseluit une étude sur les lieux qu’elle allait entreprendre.
Il confirme les renseignements donnés par le Secrétaire général en débutant, sur la Commission de la frontière gréco-bulgare, qui part de Belgrade aujourd'hui meme.
le Dr. Norman White a reçu une déreche du Dr. Rajchman, qui est arrivé au Japon.
Il a été informé officiellement par M. Ormsby Gore que la contribution de £3000 pour la mission relative à la maladie du sommeil était définitivement accordée.
A ce propos. Sir Herbert âmes rappelle que le Dr. Rajchman et là. Wilson ont reçu une lettre de mission du Secrétaire général.
Il se demande si on ne pourrait pas étendre cette pratique et éviter ainsi dans certains cas de demander soit pour les membres du Secrétariat, soit pour les membres des Commissions, les visas des pays dans lesquels ils sont appelés à se rendre.
M. Haas signale que la question d'un passeport spécial pour les fonctionnaires ou commissaires de la Société des Hâtions a été soulevée autrefois à la Conférence des Passeports; mais que 1’.assemblée de la Société des Nations s'est montrée opposée à l’établissement d'un passeport spécial délivré par le Secrétaire général. Il est d'accord avec il. j-venol pour estimer qu'il ne faut pas soulever la question de rrincipe lors de la prochaine Conférence des Passeports; mais cette dernière admettra, certainement qu'une lettre de mission délivrée par le Secrétaire vénérai puisse dispenser des visas nationaux, ce qui constituera un résultat très intéressant pour les cas d'urgence.
7
M. Man tour ajoute qu’au cours d’une conversation récente avec le Général Serrigny, ce dernier lui a signalé l’intérêt que pouvait présenter, rour une intervention re idc de représentants de la Société des dations, le faculté de se déplacer sans avoir à réclamer des visas nationaux»
le Comité se déclare d’accord; cotte pratique une fois admise ne manquera pas de se développer»
1,	M» Gilchrist signale la nomination de il. de Jouvencl comme Haut Commissaire en Syrie.
2,	M. Haas rend compte de la réunion rour le balisage et 1’éclairage des cotes qui vient d’avoir lieu enliaisen avec le Bureau International Hydrographique do Monaco, Les directeurs
des p'hares de nombreux pays européens ont pris part aux débats qui ont été très techniques, mais ont abouti à dos résultats jugés très satisfaisants par les intéressés.
En réponse à une demande qui lui est posée, il explique que si le Gouvernement anglais n’a pas été représenté, c’est en raison de la complexité de 1 ' oreranis „tion intérieure anglaise.
Il ajoute quo sa présence n1était d’ailleurs pas indispensable, ce domaine étant un de ceux où l’on peut progresser par résultats parti els,
La Russie a accepté do participer à la Conférence qui doit se tenir sur le jaugeage. Elle a fait sur l’article prévoyant lo dépôt dos ratifications au Secrétariat des réserves un peu surprenantes puisqu’elle accepte de participer h une Conférence réunie par le Conseil. Liais il n’y a pas lieu de prévoir de grandes difficultés; l’article en question ne sera certainement pas changé et tout au plus la question se posera do trouver une formule spéciale peur la Russie.

1.	le Secrétaire général annonce que la Commission envoyée
sur la frontière bulgaro-grecque pense être en mesure d'achever son rapport sur la première partie de sa mit sion le 28 novembre et de l'envoyer de Belgrade aux Gouvernements grec et bulgare, (il ne sait pas encore si oe rapport traitera toutes les questions qui ont été posées par le Conseil, y compris la dernière, ou ne sera, qu'un rapport partiel). La Commission quittera probablement Belgrade le 28 ou le 29 novembre. Des son arrivée à Genève, le rapport sera traduit, imprimé eu envoyé à tous les membres du Conseil.
le Secrétariat a repu ceux télégrammes du Général Laidoner, Dans le premier, il signale certains incidents de frontières qui, à son avis, sont dûs à la difficulté de situer sur le terrain la ligne de Bruxelles. les Turcs estiment que certains villages où ils ont envoyé des reconnaissances sont au nord de cette ligne, les autorités de l'irai: soutiennent qu'ils sont
2 -
au s ad- Tout ce que le Général laidoner suggère à ce sujet, cTest d'inviter si posait lu les Turcs à ne pas installer de nouveaux postes permanents. Il a adressé la même demande aux autorités britanniques. Il ne croit pas que cette question doive soulever
de grandes difficultés.,
Mais le Général Laidoner estime que la question des déportations de chrétiens est plus sérieuse; il a constaté ces déportations et exprime l’avis que le Conseil pourrait appeler sur elle l'attention des Turcs. Le Secrétaire général estime que dans ce cas, la meilleure méthodo à employer serait de communiquer à tous les membres du Conseil et au Gouvernement turc le télégramme du Général Laidoner.. Il a profité ao la présence à Paris de M. Avenol pour lui demander do voir à ce sujet les deux membres du Comité de Mossoul qui f 'y trouvent et .aussi le Ministre de Cuède pour qu'il tienne M, Unden au courant.
Le second télégramme du Général Laidoner annonce des détails plus complets et demande s'il doit venir à Geu.ve pour la prochaine session du Conseil, le secrétaire général estime qu'il doit venir à Genève, à moins que sa présence on Irak soit absolument indispensable. Cette question sera aussi tranchée par les membres du Gomiaé de Mossoul.
Il est certain maintenant que les accords de Locarno seront signés le 1er décembre - A co propos, le secrétaire général signale que ivu j-.schrr.urm5 Consul général d'Allemagne, est venu le voir ce matin avant de partir pour Berlin et lui a demandé des informations sur les postes qui pourraient être attribués dans
le	de cr ét ar i et	à des' fcncdonnai	re s n 1 le m an d s e t	sur les chances
de	voir vdopter	1T al le mand cc mire	lan gue officie 1	le»
	Le 3e cr	et ai re g en ér al a	répondu qu'il se	p r e o c c up ait de
la	première que	s t ion, mais qu 1 i 1	18 pouvait pour	le moment lui
donner ce renseignements utiles, Il pense aller lui-même à Berlin et y discuter la question après que l'Allemagne aura fait sa demande d'admission. Jusqu'à présent, il n ' a fait de promesse, officielle ou autre, à aucun ressortissant allemand,
3
3n co qui concerne la que et ion de 1T allemand comme langue officielle, le ¿secrétaire général a fait ressortir que cotta demande avait peu de chances de succès car elle entraînerait dos demandes analogues pour l'espagnol, l’italien, le japonais.
Le Consul d’Allemagne lui demanda alors si, à défaut de l’acceptation de l’allemand comme langue officielle, il ne pourrait pas être décidé que les documents distribués aux nombres de la Société seraient traduits en allemand.
Le Secrétaire général lui répondit qu'on se heurtait à la meme difficulté en ce oui concerne l’espagnol et les autres langues.
M. Aschmann lui demanda alors si ce n ’ était là qu'une question de dénonsesc Le Secrétaire général répondit que cos dépenses seraient très considérables et correspondraient à une grande augmentation du personnel.
3n dernier lien, le Secrétaire général fit remarquer au Consol Général allemand qu:à son avis, ce serait une très grande erreur pour l’Allemagne d’attendre l’Assemblée de septembre pour entrer dans la Société des Nations. Il lui semble nécessaire qu’avant la dite Assemblée, l’Allemagne se soit familiarisée nvoc les travaux de la Société des Nations,
3nfin M. Aschmann fit une allusion à la contribution que l’Allemagne serait appelée à payer comme membre de la Société et dit qu’il supposait qu’elle serait équivalente à celle de la Fr ance .
Le Dr. Van Hamel pense que la réponse de la Cour de Justice Internationale aux questions ^ur lesquelles la Conseil lui a demandé un avis consultatif à propos de l’affaire de ho- soul, est imminente. Il attire l’attention sur l’importance qu’elle présentera, notamment au point de vue de la procédure du Conseil dans les cjs d’arbitrage.

The Score tar y Ge nor a 1 said that the forthcoming meeting of the Council would have a number of serious and difficult matters to deal with and would probably take some time. The bconomlc Confer once, the questions connected with Disarmament and the Bulgur-Greco incident were all matters of great importance. But in view of the Turkish attitude, as reported, in the Press, the 2-osul question seemed likely to be by far the most difficult.
He had no definite information yet as to when the German application might bo expected. In this connection, he mentioned that he h" d. hn told in London that it was said th~t various members of the Gocra tm-rist h-'d	in communi-

This w ;s not liked by the Germ n Govern-ment to r-'hich some of the- incliviouals in question aopoared to belong to ¡;he unpractical order of pacifists.

The Gocrotary General referred to the passage in the Report dealing with rapidity of cotnunication with Geneva.

RECORD, ,QP IITTERVIEW»
I saw Dr. Junghann this afternoon. He telkod about tho entry of Goimany into tho Loagub, and the diffioultios which tho loaguo had experienced and was still experiencing in Germany.
Tho oanvorsation ran on the usual linos until Dr. Junghann produced a frosh train of thought.- Ho said that one of the diffioultios about Germany Joihing tho league was that they foared that if they did so, oven if the^r bocame a Member of tho Council, tho ether Groat Powers - he obviously referred to Prance and England - wpiuld bo inolinod to boycott the League on all important' political questions, and to roduco its prestige by sending second-rate men to the Council and to tho Assembly.*
I told him thab I coaid not acoopt this vidw. Ho oust remember, I said, that all the best friends of tho League in Prance, in England, and elsovhore - men such as Bran ting and Hanson - wore all in favour of Germany becoming a Manbor cf tho League.. It was not likoly that those ardent supporters of tho Loaguo would advocate Germany^ membership if thoy thought that the result would be that the Loaguo would decrease in importance.
I myself sharod their view. *• The League was becoming mere and more a public platform for international politics, and if Germany ontered and sent first-rate "people, tho other Pcjrers would autQfl^tically bo compelled to gond first-rate people too; not tha,t I thought that they had tho loast intention of doing otherwise.-
Jo than talked a littlo about the German lloto of tho 12th

I said that I raally v;as very doubtful what lay behind it.
In sone quarters it v/as said that tho note was intended to bo utilised as a reason v/hy Go many did not join tho League.
In others, it was thought til at it v/as a method of ascertaining the maximum of concessions possible, and then to say that this v/as all that German y could gat, and that thoroforo she would join tho League on those conditions.
hr. -Junghann replied that both these currants of thought wore prévalant in Germany itself, and that ho. really did not think that anybody suite know v/hat the intention of. the Bote v/as -in fact, ho gave mo to understand that probably tho result would be settled by the political atmosphere of tho nemont.
„ hr. Junghann v/as more optimistic than I had expected about the present Government, and about tho progress which tho La ague v/as making in Germany. Ho said that the League of Bâtions Union had managed to secure some adherents belonging to tho Volkspartoi and to the nationalist Party. This v/as an advance, and though porhaps it did not go very far, was significant, Tho present Government, if it could continue to get tho support of the Centro,, might last for avers7 consido-ruble time. Ho. oxplained that a now experiment vms being tried, viz., to associate tho nationalist Pa rty with a He publican foim of Government, and so to deprive then of that sen so of irresponsibility which they had so fully- shown in the past.

To the SECRETARY-GEHEIUL
from Mr, VAN HAMEL
1.	You have asked mo to make a legal examination of tho points raised in tho Gorman Roto of December 12th,
X hereby present you with the results of my orumination.
2» Tho Gorman Rote is not very categoric, or quite explicit in its conclusions; it seems therefore nocossary to gi\To a resume of the arguments which it contains.
The German Government states that it has not yet received satisfactory replies to the difficulties which it consi dors exist in oonnoction with its Membership of- the League end particularly, in view of Germany’s exceptional situation, with tho application / of Artio lo 16 of the Covenant.
It therefore '''plaocs tho problem before tho League of Rations itself in tho hope that the League will recognise tho need of a previous discussion of the matter and will therefore bo prepared to discuss it without delay."
"The problem", as explained in the Memorandum of December 12th, seems to be tho follovi ng:
the means to adapt herself rapidly to tho requirements of war, should war threaten. On the other hand, Germany is surrounded by neighbours whoso potential arguments arc unrestricted and whoso actual armaments are unlimited end powerful. This position exposes Germany to a
Germany is centrally situated and completely disarmed. ohe lochs all the necessary equipment for modern warfare, and lacks also
■"£ *-
and military measures laid down in Article 16 of the Covenant must expect to he treated as a belligerent by the Jtatc against which such League action is being taken. Even if the aggressor were not an immediate neighbour of Germany, there would always be the four of an unfavourable development of military operations carrying the war into hor territory. For the protection of this territory Germany would be absoluotly dependent upon the military protection of the Members of the League taking part in the collective actione But will such protection be properly guaranteed? If loyally carried out, the fact that non-German forces will in the mein have to provide that protection, will necessarily mako it imperfect.
l’ho German Government expresses the view that there is only one solution to the difficulties as to German participation in s one t i o n s : rin the e vont of internat ion al conflicts the Gorman Reich must bo given the possibility of determining for itself the extent of its active participation.”	''Germany is thereby only
asking that, in fixing her obligations towards the League, consideration shall bo given to her exceptional situation, us othorwiso she would bo compelled by hor entry into the League of Nations to surrender her neutrality, which is the last weapon of defence for a disarmed peopleer'
The German Government adds that it is not in a position to judge what account could be taken of its desire.	It alleges that
it is'not in possession of any authentic information as to how the detailed procedure of sanctions has boon settled or planned. Although Article 11, paragraph 2 of .the Protocol t okos into account the geographical and military position of Ltates os regards their participation in sanctions, it will not allow any Member of the Leaguo to remain neutral a& all will havo to- take part in moasuros of blockade, give active support to economic sanctions and suffer the
-3—
passage through their territory of the participating forces.
un additional observation made by the Gorman Government is: "that the whole organisation of the League nf Hat ions is soorooly compatible with the military preponderance of individual States, no matter whethof they belong to the League or not; but even if tho disarmament of other states were completed 'Within the limits of tho League (article 8 of tho Covenant,) tho general standard of armaments would still remain far above the German lovel.<:
3e It is desirable to complete this almost litoral extract frem tho arguments contained in tho Memorandum of December lSoht by quoting part of the Memorandum which was forwarded cn September 29th to the individual Governments represented on tho Council. There tho point in question is dealt with somewhat differently:
"The inequality of armaments resulting from Germany1 s disarmament males it impossible for Germany to take part in any League action under nítido 15 of tho Covenant, A disarmod nation, surrounded by strongly armed neighbours, and that cannot; even defend its frontiers, cannot possibly, in tho caso of international conflicts, givo up its neutrality* It would thereby expose itself to tho danger of being treated by the otate "on rupture du facto” as a bolligoront. For this reason tho German Government is compelled to attach a reservation to itu request for admission*,11 4, In its second Memorandum (December 12th), the Gorman Government no longer mentions the necessity of making a reservation in tho sense indicated in its memorandum of ¿eptembor 29th.
Le a matter of faot, the position takon in tho December Memorandum is much vaguer and more elastics» Ms has already boon shown in 2, it merely makes an uppcul to the League "for discussion without delay"» The last paragraph of this memorandum is written
in the same spirit: "The Gorman Govermont confidently hopes that tho league will rocogniso tho justification of its fours and will find a way of dispelling thorn. Germany believes that it is possible to tuko account of Gorman interests without thereby in any way jeopardising tho organisation of tho league or tho fulfilment of its work.”
Tho only Categoric conclusion formulated by tho Gorman Government that I have beef able to find in its last Memorandum is the son tone g which I underlined undr £; nin the ovont of international conflicts, the German Keich must be given the * 5 6
possibility of determining for itself the extent of its possibility of active participation-
But it is clear that the German Government does not make this suggestion as the only possiblo solution* The intention of the memorandum is to leave the way open for any other feasible suggestions or solutions*
5,	I may perhaps be permitted at the end of this paper (see sec. 14) to give an appreciation of the political motives which may be presumed to underlie the German paper.
To begin with, I shall endeavour to analyse t he natter from a strictly legal point of view,
6.	' There is no doubt that under article 16 of tho Covenant States Members of the league are required to take part in action of a kind which is likely to place them in a state of war with the State that has disregarded the Covenant, so that they will be exposed to warlike action on the part of such a State. It is true that military action under the existing terms of the Covenant can only be recommended to them by the Council and that suoh a.recommendation cannot be binding. But the severance of all trade and financial relations, the prohibition of intercourse, the giving of mutual support in resisting speoial
-5-
measures aimed at one Member "by the peace-breaking State and the absolute obligation to afford passage through thoip territory to the forces of any Member of the league which is co-operating to protect the Covenant, will in practioe mean that it will be to the direct interest of the peaoe-breaking State to take against any Member of the longue any action which it considers useful.
JCiegally it may be advantageous for the Coven ant-brooking State, to deolare wax upon those States which stand with the League, even if those states do not formally declare war.
Under the terms of the Protocol, this position will became even more acute.
The German Government is, therefore, right in stating that in becoming a me Elbe r of the League Germany might, and probably would, be obliged to surrender her neutrality.
It should., however, be added that this is not an incidental result of a St ate besoming a Member of the League. It is, as a matter of fact, the essence of membership of the League. The purpose of Mrtio le 16 of the Covenant is that no State shall be exempted from co-operating in the general action against a Covenant-breaking State. uccording to oiroumstassess and to the geographical ahd political situation, one state may have to take a, more active part than another, but, on principle, every State Member will bo involved in such action. Discretion may be left in the matter of direct military action. us far as the economic weapon is concerned "all States must be treated alike as regards the application of measures of eoojiomic pressure”. (Resolutions of the Second Assembly on the Economic Weapon adopted on October 4th, 1921); That Assembly added that a postponement might bo thought desirable in the case of certain individual States but only in so far as it would be desirable for the success of the common plan of action or to reduce to a minimum the fosses and embarrassments which might be entailed in
-6-
ths case of certain Members of the League by the application of sanctions (idem the 4th amendment to Article 16, not yet in force ), This latter reservation has not been repeated in the Protocol urhioh has, however, also not entirely excluded possiblo variations in the application of economic and financial sanctions by an individual State under the aithority of t-he Council, if this should be thought in the common interest. In no case, however, oan there be any question of recognising ‘'neutrality'1 s which would mean granting on entire and general dispensation from the obligation to take part in these sanctions.
The same may be said with even greater force of the duty of affording passage for military troops taking part in League action. Ho exemption from this duty has been o ontempluted either in Article 16 of the Covenant, or in the Protoool.
If neutrality means that a State has the right and the duty to remain impartial and passive (from the economio, the political and from the military point of view between the two parties at war, this neutrality is fundamentally inconsistent with the organisation of the League of Hâtions.
7) A special understanding was accepted with regard to Switzerland. but it may be useful to recall the very exceptional nature of this case.
The "neutrality" of Switzerland has formed the object of a Council Resolution, which was adopted in February 13, 1920, and of which I attach a o opy.
It will be seen from this Resolution that (a) the Council affirmed the general principle "that the conception of neutrality of the Members of the League is incompatible with-the principle that all Members will be obliged to co-operate in enforcing respect for their engagements";
(b) that no exception has been asked by Switzerland or allowed,, as far as the taking part in economic and financial
measures is concerned;
-7-
(o)	that Switzerland has recognised the duty to bo prepared to make every saorifioe to defend her own territory under all circumstances;
(d) that under those conditions Switzerland has been oonsidored as being exempt from the obligation to allow the passage of foreign troops or the preparation of military operations within her territory, and as not being obliged to take part in any military action.
Hereby the so-called military neutrality of Switzerland has been confirmed.
The Council, however, at the same time took care to emphasise the fact :
(a)	Switzerland is in a unique situation based on a tradition of several centuries, which has beon explicitly incorporated in the law of Nations, and
(b)	that the guarantee of the inviolability of Swiss territory is justifiod"by the interests of general peace and, therefore, compatible with the Covenant."
The discussions at the Council meeting moreover make it clear that the Council took into consideration the unique and traditionally recognised geographical and political position of Switzerland, which has become an uncontroversial part of International law , and that the Councils decision was supported by hrtiole 21 of the Covenant itsolf, which says that "nothing in the Covenant affects the validity of international engagements or of regional understandings for securing the maintenance of peace."
Under these circumstances, the Council has held, - and the Assembly which was informed of the Council's decision, tacitly acquieeaod- that the "military neutrality" of Switzerland, as
-9~
described in the Council. Re solution, is compatible with the
' 3 :	‘ ••;;}?• -	.<	Y. •
Covenant and that it dees’ not establish an illegal "reservation” such as -article 1 of the Covenant condemns.
8)	This is tho only case in whioh the "neutrality"
of a country has coma under consideration. Luxembourg,, when applying for member ship, did not maintain claim for neutrality, l'he notetralisation or demilitarisation of coxtain zones by special conventions, such asr for instanCo by the .¿aland Islands Convention, does not seem to bo a case in point.
Norway has lately oxpliojbly given up the special internet ional guarantee of her territory, which had previously been established.
9)	It will be soon that the point of neutrality, as suggested by Germany, is in no way analogous to that of Switzerland., .us far as Germany is conaoxned, no existing traditional internei ional understanding can bo referrod to. article 21 of the Covenant would offer no ground for exemptien. It could: not be urged, moreover, that the neutrality of Germany would bo in the interest of scouring general peace.
In the seoond plaoe, Switzerland has declared that she is in a position to defend her om territory and is desirous of so doing, whilst Germany asserts thut sho is not capable of any defence.
In the third, place, no question of economic or finanoial neutrality was raised by Switzerland whilst in tho German request this plays an important part, Switzerland on the contrary explicitly recognised her "economic solidarity". Only by the very special circumstances of hor ocso and by her owndefeefli-vs military power, will
■9-
Switzorlsnd find it possible to romain out of military conflicts notwithstending her participation in economic and financial sanctions. In the caso of Germany this would seem to bo impossible.
Moreover united action by the leaguo against a poaco-broaking State would not be impedod if a small country suok as Switzerland took no part in that action; the loss of a finger may not prevent action, which the loss of an arm would make impossible,
10)	I would conclude from all this that a special clause in Germany's adhesion to the league, - a clause by which she would reserve the right to remain neutral during the execution of league action under article 16 of the Covenant or under the Protocol, or a clause by which sho would resorve the right to determine for herself tho extent of her active participation, particularly in tho application of the economic weapon - would constitute a reservation which is not admitted by any Article of the Covenant and which is d .finitely excluded by article 1, which says that "Members of the league shall accede without reservation to the Covenant."
It is true that this requirement of accession without reservation is not repoated literally in the second paragraph of Article 1, which deals \7ith the admission of States which have not become original members. The admission of Germany would take place under this second paragre.ph. It has, however, always been assumed that newly admitted States should also enter without reservations. No such State has ever made, or boon allowed to make, such reservations.
Of courso a special contractual arrangement between the Members of the le egue and a newly entering Member, such as Germany, concerning its special position, is not excluded legally or theoretically. This point will bo dealt with under 18.
11)	The German memorandum complains that Germany is not capable of providing for the security of her own territory. This is the principal reason for her request for an exceptional po sit ion.
The point may be^made that othor countrios may equally be in a position of being unable to defend their own territory
J
in cases of common action of the League of Nations under .article 16. A good many of the smaller countries would, in the cose of League action, be equally exposed to invasion or attacks, if thoy were entirely left to their own resources. It may not be necessary to mention names of specific States. Perhaps attention may be called - although they are not the only ones - to the pther States which are placed under obligations of disarmament by tho Poace Treaties. 1'hoso States have all entered the League of Nations knowing that they would -be unable either to take an active part in military action by tho League or to defend their own
A
territory with, their own forces against all the complications to which a general war against a Covenant-breaking State might load.
It has always boon understood that the compensation for t k the League-obligations to join in any common action, consists in the obligation of the othor Members of the Le ague to help a State which, by that common action, is placed in a particularly
difficult situation
-11-
This argument might also be applied to the German case,
Artie la 10 of tne Covenant of the League guarantees to the 1¡embers the respect of their territorial integrity and existing political independence*, and contains the promise of all Members of the League to preserve such territorial integrity and independence against external aggression. Hero is the general defensive assistance on which so many Members of the League will have to rely in case of League action. Article 16, in its third paragraph, states expressly that the Members of the League will "mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the Covenant-broaking State".
Would it not mean the undermining of those basic League principles of common action and mutual assistance if one country wore allowed to stay out?
It would seem that Germsnyrs attention should be called to these clauses of the Covenant and to the general spirit of the League. It should be made clear to her that the risks Germany is running do not differ from those v/hich many ether States have already undortakon, and that the best manner of reducing such risks to a minimum would bo to join the Leaguo in a spirit of scrupulous respect for international obligations - a respect upon which she in turn can count from the Members of the League.
Germany compares the state of armaments in her neighbours with her own disarmed position. Would it net be fair to recall the Preamble to Part Y of the Treaty of Versailles concerning the military, naval and air clauses, which says that " in order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the military, naval and air clauses which follow" The request for non-participation
-12-
as now presented by tho Gorman Government, runs counter to such a development. This request considers as permanent a state of armaments, which the bena-fide, unreserved and whole-hearted participation of Germany in the League might do much to reduce.
To agroo to the arguments put forward by Germany for her exclusion from tho obligation to participate in League action, would bo to assume tho permanency of a political situation and of a state of national armaments which the members of the League havo, under the Covenant itself (Article 8} undertaken to modify. Only by the admission of Germany under tho full obligations accepted by tho other Members can such a nodofication i„ec such a reduction of national armaments - be brought nearer.
12)	The Germ ah Government assumes that in the case of a League war under Article 16/ Germany, while staying out of the League, would be able to maintain a firm and strict neutrality.
In the first place, is an aggressor State which has violated the solemn covenants of the League or, if a non-member, which has refused to accept tho reasonable obligations of membership, likely to respect the neutrality of Germany if its own political interests indicate the opposite action. 'Gill Germany's neutrality, if she stays outside the League, be really protected in law or practice against an aggressor State? It is a far more plausible view that such a state would desire to make every uso of Gorman territory, which the Gorman Government asserts it would not bo able to protect. In this event, Germany would be exposed to tho complications of war, without possessing the guarantees offered to its members by the Covenant of the League.
This argument also holds good in tho caso of an aggressor State, which is not a Member of the League. Such a State would hove received an invitation, under Article 17, to accept tho obligations of membership for the maintenance of peace, but would have reiused the invitation.
-13-
It is moreover not at all certain that the existing doctrines of the rights and duties of neutrality will remain unaltered in the case of an action of the League of Nations against a Ccvonant-breâking State. The character of such a general action and its moral basis will differ so obviously from the cases of previous wars between individual Powers, in which the principles of neutrality have been developed, that it is impossible to foretell how far these principles will be recognised and applied intact by the parties concerned, in the case of a conflict of all ag ..inst one, arising under Article 16.
The traditional notion of neutrality has grown from the assumption of equality, - equality from the point of view of justice and morals, between the two belligerent parties , but this will be entirely different in a case of action by the League* It is, therefore, not impossible that the rights and duties of States non-Members of the League which desire to remain neutral, will be considered in a somewhat different light by these States which stand and fight for the principles of the League. This might become a very practical question in the case of a country like Germany occupying, in a European conflict, a central position which the other States would bo unable to ignore. Would it really be possible for a country like Germany to remain neutral in the midst of a joint action by the Members of the League against a State which has refused to comply with the rules for the maintenance of peace? And under these circumstances, would not Germany^ most
-14"
profitable position be that of a whole-hearted Member of the League?
13« It may bo desirable now to return once more to the request, formulated by the German Government that "in the event of international conflicts the Gorman Mulch must be given the possibility of determining for itself the extent of its active participation" .
Let us consider in detail the extent of the obligations of a Member of the League to participate in general action.
.article 16 of the Covenant requires unconditional participation in the severance of all economic relations, in the prohibition and prevention of intercourse, and in the furnishing of mutual support for the execution of these measures, It may be held that Article 11 of the Protocol corroborates this obligation.
This is certainly a form of active participation,
which is not left to the individual determination of
*
Members of the League,
In the second plaoc, there is the obligation of a Member of the League to take the necessary steps to afford passage through its territory, to the forces of other Members which are co-operating to protect the League covenants. This is, I repoett, also a categoric obligation« Does it, however, constitute a form of "active participation" the extent of which Germany asked to be allowed to determine for herself? It is not improbable that the German Government believes that the duty of affording passage is implied in what it calls "active participation" ( in the original
"Aktive To ilnahmc" ). It may, however, he pointed out that,
-15-
af for ding passage to troops is a p as s iv o rather than an active fofm of participation, and the question might therefore be raised whether Germany would accept that obligation without demanding further individual discretion?
The third form of obligation consista in contributing to the armed forces to be used to protect- the covenants of the league afid in furnishing mutual support in resisting any special measures aimed at one of the Members hy the Covenant-breaking Stâte. These are certainly obligations of active participation. The Covenant, however, has not laid down special provisions determining the extent of participation required of each Member of the League. The actual execution of these obligations is to a groat extent left to the individual decision and to the individual sense of duty of each 1'embor of the League. According to Article 16 of the Covenant, the Council may make recommendations. This also is the sense of Article 10«. Article 11 of the Protocol has further defined these principles by saying that each of the ’’Signatory States shall be obliged to co-opexato loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant and in resistance to any act- of aggression, in the degree which its geographical position and its particular situation as regards armaments allow". This certainly leaves a considerable amount of individual discretion to each Member of the League in determining the extent cf its active participation, and tho question arises whether Germany really needs any special assurances in this respect.
It has ,marwovor, always been understood that no country will be obliged to participate beyond its means or to make any effort beyond its powers, Germany would certainly not be asked to do more than could in reason be expected from

l'he Council will, I may add, play an important part in recommending ana in eo-ordinating the "active participation” incumbent upon each of the llombers of the League. This is particularly so in the caso of military action, as stated explicitly in Article 16 of the Covenant „ But it will also be the case with regard to the organisation of economic action and economic mutual assistance, as has always been understood when the practical side of the application of the economic weapon has been considered. No.lC of the assembly Resolutions of October 4th,1921, places upon the Council the duty of recommending a .joint plan of adtion, Article 12 of the Protocol emphasises the importance of the C-ounoil’s fund tiens in drawing up plans for the organisation and application of the economic and financial sanctions against an aggressor State. It is clear that in all these cases, the Council’s decision, although regulated by tin requirements of the success of the common action, will take into consideration the individual position c-f various States, Svery State should bo able to rely upon the Council’s desire to take its position into consideration, Germany - which appears to have obtained the assurance of being given a permanent seat on the Council - will then moreover have a direct voice in these matters. She will play a part in determining the plan'" of League action and çan therefore give weight to her own interests without any special assurances.
Does not this offer sufficient guarantee that considerable account will be taken of her interests?
14. In considering the weight of the various arguments set forth above and of the possible form of any reply that it may be thought desirable to maleo to Germany, greet
-17-
imp or tan ce must, of course, "be attached to the probable intentions cf the German Government in presenting its memorandum. Has it arisen from an earnest desire to beoomo a Member of the League and from the desire to remove certain difficulties by joint consideration? Or, is it a "move" calculated to place the Members of tho League cf Nations in a difficult position to argue their case .and in order to create plausible pretexts for remaining outside tho League?
I find it hard to mate up my mind on this point. If any other nation cf greater practical experience and of a mature political mentality were concerned, I am afraid that I should conclude at once that the second was the true reason.
Appearances are rather in favour of thu view that the points made about the armaments of neighbouring States and about Germany’s condition of disarmament are used tc checkmate the Members of the League, whilst keeping free from their association. Attention may also bo called tc the action taken by Germany during tho discussions cf the conditions cf peace in May 1919, when M. Brockdcrff-Rantzsu said in his Note: ”La Délégation allemande so declare prSto à négocier sur la base do la charte de la Ligue des Hatic-nc contenue dans le Projet de Tiraito de Paix, a condition nue l’Allemagne soit admise a la Ligue des Nations dès la signature du Traite de Paix qui sera adopte, et avoe los memes droits que les autres Puissances’’ and later ’’Guide p^r le sentiment que la Ligue des Nations réaliser» l’idée du Droit, et à la condition que l’Allemagne sera admise dans la Ligue dès Nations, dos la conclusion de la paix et avec les mûmes droits que les autres Puissances, le Gouvernement dw la République allemande est prêt à souscrire a l’Idee

"La stipulation suivant laquelle aucun pays nTost soumis a un controls spécial des armaments en dehors do celui de la Société des Iîations soit egalement applicable a l'Allemagne".
At that moment Germany made ne mention of any special conditions of "neutrality" but only demanded admission on an equal
footing, a condition which she could easily obtain now. This point could certainly be made in reply to the Gorman Government.
r
The second argument used in tha. second quotation reappears to some extent- in the present.Memorandum which seems to imply that, either the promise must he given of n general reduction of armaments of all States, or Germany cannot be expected to enter the League of Hat ions .
I shall not consider here whether any allusion to this
side of the question should be inserted derm an Government.
in a reply to the
-19-
Anothor feature of the Memorandum of December 1924, points to political unwillingness rather than to political willingness on the part of Germany. The whole point of "'neutrality” as emphasised by tho Memorandum would hoof particular practical value in the case of a conflict between Russia and Poland, if the latter wore supported b^ the League of Rations. Is the Memorandum an effort on the part of Germany to reserve for Russia the advantages of a neutral Germany, in the case of a conflict with the Lg ague .
I said above that with nations of more practical experience and of a more mature political mentality I should scarcely host it ate in estimating the real intention of the Memorandum of December 12th, but I desire to emphasise tho point that a paper emanating from the German Government under the present- circumstances, need not necessarily be tested on the saoi^ lines.
.We should never forgot, in the first place, that the German mentality is not political but abstract and theoretical. It is quite possible that tho true explanation of tho points made in the Memorandum of December 12th, is tho irresistable attraction for the German mind of general legal problems without thought for their political significance.
a. German Government, in order to win the admiration cf all classes of the population, will bo practically, obliged to deal with these matters in a somewhat academic and exhaustive manner. If this element docs not account fer a hundred per cent of the Gorman
-20-
demarche and of tho contents of the Memorandum of December 12th, i*; certainly does account for a greet deal. In the second place it should bo remembered that at this moment Germany is politically in a situation of great uncertainty; a situation of internal and external oscillation; she is groping about without seeing a clear way out,
I.Iy final diagnosis of tho Memorandum would bu
this. It contains a large proportion of legal arguments
without a definite practical aim; it shows a considerable
amount of political uncertainty, and a readiness to seize
opportunities in two directions - either in the direction
of keeping the League of Dations on tender hooks
without incurring any odium thereby or in the direction
*
of entering tho League, even unconditionally, if this is made reasonably easy.
Thife diagnosis leads tc the conclusion th- t if ny reply is sent, it should be on tho following lines:
The'German Government’s memorandum should be taken in good faith but its details should not be taken toe seriously, tho League’s case for international peace, morals and justice should he emphasised in claiming full participation in League action, and reasonable solutions of Germany’s difficulties should be offered, without granting her an exceptional position; tho impossibility of creating such a special position should be clearly shown.
-21-
15. The reply to the German Government night take then the foil o'wi ng f o r m :
Gerrany &3ks that, in fixing her obligations towards the tongue, consideration should be given to her exceptional Situation, and that, in the event of international conflicts, the German 3eieh should be given the possibility of determining for itself the extent of its active participation.
Gorinany will realise that it is iir.po :;sible to place her,or any Member of the Longue, in an exceptional situation whereby her rights and duties would differ in principle from, the rights and duties of other Members, in the case of joint action of the Members of the League against a Covenant-breaking State or against a State which has refused in case of a dispute to accept the obligations of Membership in the Teague.
One of the basic principles of the League of Nations, by which it will be enabled to contribute most effectively to the maintenance of justice and the scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another, lies in the joint undertaking of al1 its Members to apply collective sanctions against a State endangering the peace of the world. Germany, when she desires, as the memorandum states she does, to enter the League of Nations, would not wish to cause a rift in the moral armour of the League or a weakening of the real powers which the League needs for any action it may have to take. It is clear that any legal exemption from the duty to take'part in the economic and financial sanctions contemplated by Article 16 of the Covenant would necessarily cause a weakness in the organisation of the League. This also applies to th<x obligation to give mutual support in resisting any special measures aimed at one of the Members of the League by the Covenant-breaking Gteto, and to the obligation to afford free passage through their territories to ’h forces of any Member
-22-
whioh is oo-oporating to protect the covenant3 of the League,
At tho same tiro Germany should under 3 tend that no Member of the League ’Til 1 have to contribute rr.ore to the corr.on action than is within its powers and cun within reason bo cl aimed,
The difficulties of which Germany is complaining do not exist with regard to Germany alone. They may be felt by many Members of the League, yet they have all ir.r-do the sacrifice if accepting the obligations expressed in the Covenant. All these practical difficulties will hr vo to be considered 'ton the case arises. 71 th regard to p; rticipation in military action, tho Covenant leaves to tho Council of tho League tho «.uty of making recommendations to tho individual Members, and the Council will have to take into account tho particular position of each. This has boon further emphasised b, the Protocol. Tho Council ’Till also bo entrusted v’ith tho preparation of plans for tho application of tho economic and financial sanctions. Could not Germany rely upon tho wisdom and ror.soncblonoss of the Counoil in proposing the measures to be t? ken?
This is still more the esc sinew Germany assumes that she will herself bo regularly represented on the Council.
Many Members of tho League may, as Germany states with regard to herself, be compel 1 :-d to look for assistance and support from their co-Membera ?..g? inst -* State which breaks tho peace of the world. The principles of this support and assistance are clearly laid down in the Covenant.
In spite of these possibilities, other States h; vo Joined the League without hesitation and in full confidence. How does Germany's position differ from theirs?

Tho last question now to ho considered is whether such a re pi :/ should ho given and by whom?
On principle and fr or the politic?:. 1 point of view it would so or’ desirable for the Tes vu to givo a substsnti.nl reply to the Germ-n memorandum and that without muoh delay. This, moreover, would be of considerable importance for the League's position -in public opinion,
3y whom should the reply b j given?
Germany h.vs addressed herself to the "compet ,-nt authorities of the League of Mitions". This might moan either
-24-
the Council or the Assembly.
On principle th-e ..ssembly would epooar to bo the proper organ to give a reply. _ Germany a ska for assurances from. the Members of tho League. The Assembly is the body which represents all those ¡•lor.ber3, and assurances given in their name should properly be given by tho /assembly. The Council could hardly be expected in this case to undertake engagements in tho name of the Harbors* On tho other hand, tho next Assembly is far off and an extraordinary
;sserbly could hardly be called for drafting a reply to the German memorandum. It would be regrettable to delay dealing with the German memorandum till September 1925. The Council on the other hand ''may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of tho Teague" (Article 4 of the Covenant). In previous cases it has under this Article taken far-reaching action, for instance, in making the arrangement conoorning the neutrality of Switzerland. It was the Council which took the original resolution. This resolution was communicated to the Assembly and it has been assumed that if the Assembly had wished to disavow the Council's action, it could hove done-so. The Assembly has been heir* to hove tacitly acquiesced therein. In a similar manner the Council might take the responsibility of sanding a reply to the German memorandum. The Council would hove full powers to do so, as long as it gave no promises or undertakings in the name of the other members of the League.	reply containing suggestions
which might help the German Government to overcome its difficulties would certainly be within the Council's powers.
The Council would moreover probably desire to reserve the right of the Assembly to discuss the matter at n later da,te. ■
-25-
17.	- The terms in which the German request has been couched Gould also he hold to suggest the possibility of a reply to tho effect that 11 in tho case of Teague action in Which Germany takes part, she right ho allowed to extend without limitation hor armaments and military forces for the common benefit’’«
Such a suggestion, however, is not thought practical or advisable•
18.	- I have not examined the possibility of actually laying down for Germany an exceptional legal position. It may be sufficient to state that if such a position should be created, tho best method would probably be by a special agreement between the Members of tho League and Germany, an agreement which should then be ratified by all tho Members.
An Assembly resolution would not be enough to exempt Germany from, certain obligations, nor would it seem that exemption could properly be made by an amendment to the Covenant. In
i
the case of Switzerland the circumstances were different, as here tho special arrangement could be based on an existing principle of international law which Article 21 of the*
Covenant recognised as valid.
The suggestion of a special agreement regulating the relations between an individual State and the Members of the League has also n somewhat more general interest, as it has
been considered in connection with two other eases. When the
\
Assembly studied the possible relations between the League \ -
; \
%
and States too small to bo considered as ordinary Members, the idee, was considered of establishing a special agreement between such States and tho league. In the second place it seems
-26-
that certain circles in the United States have considered the possibility of basing relations between the League and the United States upon such a special agreement, regulating their country's individual obligations and rights. It has eveh been said that uny special arrangement between Germany and the Leagu would indicate a forr in which relations could be established botwoon the United States and the League,
This could not, however, in my view, constitute any argument in favour of recommending a special and exceptional arrangement between Germany and the League.

ANNEX.
RESOLUTION Of THE COUNCIL.
(Sixth Meeting of the Second Session, hAd in London on 13th February, 1920),
The Council of the To&,?«e of Notions, while affirming that the conception of neutrality of the Members of tho League is incompatible with the principle that all Members will ho obliged to co-operate in enforcing respect for their engagements, recognises that Switzerland is in a unique situation, based on a tradition of several centuries, which has been explicitly incorporated in tho Lav/ of Nations; and that the Members of the Le'ggi*« of Nations, signatories of tho Treaty of Versailles, have rightly recognised by Article 435 tin: t the guarantees stipulated in favour of Switzerland by the Treaties of 1815 and especially by tho Act of 20th November, 1815, constitute international obligations for the maintenance of peace. The Members of the League of Nations arc- entitled to expect that the Swiss noopie will not stand aside when tho high principles of tho longue have to be defended. It is in this sense that tho Council of the League has taken note of the declaration made by the Si-73 3 Government in its Message to the federal Assembly of 4th August, 1919, and in its Memorandum of 13th January,1920, which declarations have been confirmed by the Swiss Delegates at the meeting of the Council and in accordance with which Switzerland recognises and proclaims the duties of
solidarity which membership of tho League of Nations imposes upon her, including therein the iuty of oo-operating in such

RESOLUT ION LU C0IÎ.31 IL.
(Sixième séance de la deuxième session, tenue à Londres
le 13 février 1320.)
Le Conseil de la Société des Nations, tout en affirmant le principe due la notion de neutralité des membres de la Société des Nations n’est pas compatible avec cet autre principe que tous les membres de la Société auront à agit en commun pour faire respecter ses engagements, reconnaît que la suisse est dans une situation unique motivée par une tradition de plusieurs siècles, qui a été explicitement incorporée dans le Droit des Gens; et que les liembres de la Société des Nations, signataires du Traité de Versailles, ont à bon droit reconnu par l’article 435 que les garanties stipulées en faveur de la Suisse par les Traités de 1815 et notamment par lU-ete du ÏO novembre 1815, constituant des engagements internationaux pour le maintien de la Paix.
Les Uembres de la Société des Nations ont le droit de s’attendre à ce que le peuple suisse ne veuille pas s'abstenir s’il s’agit de défendre les hauts principes de la Société. C'est en ce sens que le Conseil de la Société a pris connaissance des déclarations faites par le Gouvernement suisse dans son Message à l’Assemblée fédérale du 4 août 1919 et dans son mémorandum du 13 janvier 13.-0, déclarations qui ont été confirmées par ies Délégués suisses à la réunion du Conseil et d'après lesquelles la Juisse reconnaît et proclame les devoirs de so-

lidarité gui résultent pour elle cm fait qu'elle sera Membre de la Société des Motions, y compris le devoir de participer ou.:’ mesures commerciales et financières demandées par la Société des Mations contre un Etat en rupture du Pacte et est prête à tous les sacrifices pour défendre elle-même son propre territoire en toutes circonstances, meme pendant une action entreprise par la société des Nations, mais qu'elle ne sera, pas tenue de participer à une action militaire ou d'admettre le passage ce troupes étrangères ou la préparation d'entreprises militaires sur son territoire.
En acceptant ces déclarations le Conseil reconnaît ique la neutralité perpétuelle do la Cuisse et la garantie de l'inviolabilité ce son territoire telles qu'elles sont acquises au Droit des Gens, notamment par les Traités et l'acte de 1815, sont .justifiées par les intérêts de la paix générale et en conséquence sont compatibles avec le Pacte.
Pour ce qui concerne la déclaration d'accession à faire par le Gouvernement suisse, le Conseil de la Société des Nations ayant en vue la constitution tout à fait particulière de la Confédération suisse, est d'avis que la notification basée sur la décision de l'Assemblée fédérale et effectuée dans le délai de deux mois à partir du 10 janvier 1920, date de l'entrée en vigueur du Pacte de la Société des Nations, pourra être acceptée par les autres membres de la Société comme la déclaration exigée par l'article 1 pour l'admission comme Membre originaire, à condition que la
confirmation de cette Déclaration par le peuple et les cantons suis ses soit effectuée dans le plus bref délai possible.

Genève, le 2 février 1925.
Suite à donner à la note de 1* ,,llbnKgne relative aux oonditiond éventuelles de son admission dans la Société,
le Dr. von Hamel, se plaçant naturellement au point de vue juridique, s* est préoccupé avant tout des deux questions suivantes : Qui a qualité pour répondre, au nom de la .joc-iété des 1 étions, au mémoire allemand du 12 décembre 1924 ? et quels sont les principes dont devrait s’inspirer cette réponse ? Tout en me rr 1 liant à ses conclusions, j’ai été amené à me poser la Question sous un outre ongle plus immédiatement pratique.
Ce qui doit nous préoccuper, c’est l’action éventuelle du Conseil, le Conseil peut-il agir, doit-il agir, de quelle manière pourr it-i'l agir ?
Sur le premier point le Dr. v:n Hamel n déjà répondu. Il est évident que la note adressée à la " Société des Hâtions” - formule vague empruntée, selon le Gouvernement allemand, à eert ines des réponses ou'il aurait reçues des Puissances avec lesouelles il a déjà correspondu à ce sujet- s'adresse en réalité à 1’Assemblée, qui seule pourrait répondre au nom de tous les membres de la Société et oui, cie plus,, est l'autorité constitutionelle en
s
ta tière à’v'àfâissim» i* lis le Conseil, c.’-cpiès l’article 4; rlinéu 4 de. Pacte u eorifl-.it de toutes questions rentrant d.'tna 1' sphère d’activité de li; Société". de plus., il a seul le droit de sT .¿joindra un. nouveau membre permanent, situation que 1’ llajcve.no réelle et rue les réponses reçues des Gouver* nansits représentés u Conseil lui donnent .liai d’espézez. Il est donc inévitable, si TT 11-33 igné dam nde son admission, que le Conseil It, h. un certain moment, à se prononcer et il ne 3a fer it évidemment qu’en tenant oûfnnte de toutes les données du oï obièmes tel rue If ' llem gne elle-meme le pose. îvis la question présente, s’est de savoir si le Conseil doit s’occuper -de. cette ou option inné- internant, ou à une dote pxôch ine, s- rue ntten.ara le moment où ses délibérations servi ont an ou ci ou a sorte combinées V ec celles de 1’ ■* s s emblée .
Quelles rua soient les in tan tions du Gouvernement 'lîemnd, il ter .it dan per au;:, pour l'ai^rne permanent de la Sociétéde res ter silencieux. Ji 1’■'!.» amagne désire vraiment son entrée dns la Société et cherche sincèrement, à sortir de dix il eu lté s dont ses réserves actuelles sont l’expression* ce silence pouz-ï'it être xeoréBenté comme un refus d’aider le Gouvernement aîlemond à conv incre son opinion publique que l’intérêt du p‘ç,Ts est \P entrer d ns lv Société des Iv tions. Si vu contr ire le Gouvernement llemind, déjà informé pnr une correspond• née récente du sentiment de chrci.n des ütnts membres au Conseil, se livre simplement à une manoeuvre dfns le but de rester en dehors de la Société et d’en attribuer 1° responsabilité à 1‘ Société ella-m&me, il serait nréfér"ble de percer cette manoeuvre et de mettre bien en lumière l’attitude vériiv b le de cha cun des intéressés , Pour ces raisons, il
- 3 -
p-.irit désirable que la Cens ail, qui u indubitablement la droit de s'ce duper de 1 r cueetion, s ni si s se lu plus prochaine occasion de le f.JLre*
(Joianent pourrait-il agir ? Jeux voies, semble-t-il, lui sont ouvertes . Il peut examiner st dis ou ter la question et f-ire donn ftre ensuite son opinion sur lés • rgumjnts contenus d ns cette lettre , Ce serait simplement lu suite
de la correspondance déjà échangée entre eh cun de ses membres et le Gouvernement '"llem'nd» liais la réponse serait, cette fois, collective. Il s’agirait ‘lors pour 1' ,iIl an a-gne de décider entre le maintien de celles de ces questions qui auraient été déel rées in: ccept- blés ; et I- possibilité d'être ' dreise ci 1_< oOciéte«
On peut concevoir une seconde métode. Elle consister: it , près un échange de vues entre les membres du Conseil, à annoncer simplement la n opération d’un rapport destiné à éei irer une future délibération de 1’ ¡¿semblée, celle-ci étant, nèa tout, 1Tautorité compétente en matière admission. Ln Comité du Conseil, où un de ses membres, ser i t désigné comme r pporteur, pourrait en être chargé, ¿a taohe serait, non seulement d'examiner 1* note allemande elle-même, en prenant l'avis de juristes, mais ¿s recueillir les informations permet t nt de définir et de comparer les intérêts en causé, Ce travail ne pourrait se f- ira sans de multiples conversations, t nt - vec le Gouvernement allemand qp ' r- vec divers nombres de la Jociété.

Aux arguments contenus clans la note àn Dr. Van Eamel , on pourrait ajouter les observations suivantes :
1°)	Au paragraphe 7 de sa note le Dr. van Hamel s’attache
à écarter toute assimilation entre le cas de 11 llcmagno et celui de la Suisse oui, en entrant à la Société des Hâtions, a pu conserver sa neutralité traditionnellet lion seulement la Suisse se
trouve,	en raison d	.e son histoire,	dans un	cas excep ti onnel >	
mais il	importe de	faire remarquer	qu 'elle	nT: pas eu à	ooilici-
ter son	admission j	la Société des	nations	. Allé fi?:ure	cn effet
sur la liste des xtats invitas, dès l’origine, à. accéder au Pacte, et cette invitation lui a été faite en pleine connaissance de sa situation internationale, laquelle venrit u'être confirmée de la manière le. plus formelle par l’article 435 uu Traité de Versailles» l'Assemblée n’avait pas à se prononcer sur l’admission de la ^ Suisse, et lu Oonseil, en examinant les observa-ions présentées par le Gouvernement suisse eu sujet du maintien de son statut particulier, n'a fait pue constater une situation dej\ connue» le caractère exceptionnel de cette situation est bien marqué car ce qui s’est passé lors de l'admission- -du Luxembourg» Le Gouvernement luxembourgeois, en demandant son entrée dans la Société, avait sollicité le privilège de conserver le statut de neutralité militaire dont il avait joui depuis I1J7. l'Assemblée se refusa à souscrire à cette requête, quoique le Luxembourg put faire valoir sa complète impuissance militaire et les dangers de sa position géographique»
le Gouvernement luxembourgeois d’ailleurs s'inclina devant cette décision et entra dans la Société sans garantie de
neutrali té..
- 6
g°	Si le cas de l’Allemagne n'est pas comparable à
celui de la Suisse/ il est en revanche très analogue à celui de plusieurs Ltats admis dans la Société depuis sa fondation, ' L’Autriche, par le Traité de Str Germain, la Bulgarie, par le Traité de Heu illy,' la Hongrie, par le Traité de Trianon, se sont vu imposer des conditions de désarmement semblables à celles que prescrit le Traité de Versailles, Ohacun de ces pays est entouré de voisins mieux armés, et aucun d’eux ne possède, en ce qui concerne la population, les ressources industrielles, les avantages qui laisseront toujours à l’Allemagne, quelles que soient les dispositions des traités, la situation et la force éventuelles d’une grande puissance, Ces trois Etats ont été admis dans la Société des Hâtions sans réserve fondée sur leur puissance militaire.
Si l’Allemagne était dispensée des obligations de 1 ’article 15, comment serait-il possible de continuer à les imposer à l’Autriche, à la Hongrie, et 1 la Bulgarie ? Le plus, aucun de ces trois Etafs n’a demandé, ni n’aurait pu obtenir, un siège permanent dans le Conseil: celui-ci pourrait être difficilement, semble-t-il accordé 1 un membre de la Sooiété qui aurait été préalablement exempté de toutes les obligations onéreuses du Pacte.

Les grands journaux de Tokio du 1er janvier publient une interview, accordée par le ministre des ¿affaires Itranmères, le baron SHILr.ïLiKa., à tous les reporters, au sujet des affaires étrangères; après avoir exposé les évènements qui se sont produits au cours de l'année 1924, le Ministre a dit qu’il a la ferme conviction que le monde actuel s'achemine résolument vers une ère de coopération internationale à la base de laquelle se trouvera l'idée
2
ôe pt.iT- et de justice et 1T esprit de loyauté. Il en u cité comme preuve 1» exécution du plan Eh.WIS et 1T élaboration du Irotocole, Il romoroue que des conflits et dos désaccords se sont produits et se produiront encore par suite des cliver venc es des traditions historiques nationales, des conditions économiques, etc..., mais qu’il ne serait nas raisonnable de prétendre pour cela nue l'i-ee du reniement pacifique des différends internationaux est chimérique et rue la tendance militariste et impérialiste renne comme auparavant dans le monde actuel. Ce ne sont que des
cailloux sur le	cb emin d’uno èï	-e runrvoll e dc so li à	‘.rit é	intern.tionsle,
qui se fortifie	et s ’ impose ch-.	ûuc année du vanta?e	. Ces	obstacles pour-
ront être surmontés Par une compréhension amicale et bienveillante des droits et des intérêts des autres m tions en même tempe que de ses propres intérêts.
P'est-ce pas justement, dit le Linistre, l’idéal do la. Société des lh.:tions, qui prévoit la fr. ternit'- commune dos '-eu”.les et lu pacification des -tuts du monde. Cette politique de coopération internationale plus étroite, dont parle le ¡.linistre des .affaires Etrangères, le baron SHUEHiiSa, a été plus heureusement mise en relief dans son discours à la Diète, le 22 janvier dernier lorsqu’il a dit que le Japon a le devoir de participer è toutes les coopérations interne tionales, du fuit ou’il est un des membres Principaux de lu Société des 11 tions et qu’il a, pur conséquent, une très grande responsabilité dans lu nuix et le bien être du monde entier. Il a fuit ressortir dans son discours que les grandes lignes de la politique japonaise a venir doivent être toujours conduites vers le concert international sur une buse juste et équitable, - concert entre nations sur lequel seul repose l'intérêt véritable et éternel du Jupon.
Co discours, ou 1 a été reproduit in extenso dans presque tous les journaux de Tokio et dans quelques uns de province, u. fuit naître de nombreux et excellents commentaires dans 1- presse des jours suivants et le "JIJI" a écrit eue son .„dresse u été lu meilleure ou’on n'ait jamais
éditée à une pareille

Nombreux sont los articles, parus sur la question du désarmement, dans les journaux du nouvel an.
Ma 08ÀIII, l'un des députés connus comme fervents partisans de l'antimilitarisme, écrit à ce propos dans le "JIJI" du 1er janvier que la situation actuelle du monde et notamment celle des pays anglo-saxons ot le Japon est trop sombre, trop nuageuse pour convoquer immédiatement une conférence du désarmement, et si une pareille conférence ne pouvait aboutir a d'heu-Yeux résultats - ce qui est fort probable - cet échec aurait de fâcheuses répercussions sur la situation politique mondiale.
Ivl. ObAKI craint qu'il ne s'ensuivit, fatalement, une compétition de conflits plus fréquents et mémo do guerres -, qui amèneraient la décadence du monde.
M. OSAKI prêche donc tout d'abord pour l'amélioration de la situation critique du monde, surtout de celle qui existe entre l'Angleterre et les Etats-Unis d'une part et le Japon d'autre part avant que soit convoquée une conférence du désarmement.
le nombreux journaux, tels que "CHUGAI BHYOGYO",
" YOKIO A3AHI”, "JIJI" et "HOCHI" sans parler des autres, ont publié pendant plusieurs jours consécutifs les longs articles sur le désarmement, donnés par des spécialistes, (trois articles de M. GARY J G.UüJJIlî dans le "CHJGAI SHYOGYÜ", un article de M. ASHIDa dans le’1 JIJI", un article de M. S0YE1A dans le "Hochi", plusieurs articlos de MM. SUYAHIRO et Y0IÎ13ÏA dans "Uokio Asahi", et quelques éditoriaux dans "Osaka Asahi", etc....)
Les articles de M. GARYU GAXUJIH sont particulièrement concrets et des plus intéressants; ils ont donné lieu à une très grande publicité, l'auteur commente l'ori-
4
gine ment ; le et
et le développement des dispositions relatives au dé il fait ensuite l1historique du traité d'assistance arrive enfin, à l'examen du protocole.
sarme-
mutuel-
Apr'-s avoir exposé l'esprit et le but dans lequel lo protocole a été conçu, il so demande s'il y aurait lieu ou non de convoquer la conférence sur le désarmement, prévue par le protocole do Genève, II émet dos doutes quant a la ratification du protocole par l'Empire britannique étant donné l'opinion générale des dominions, qui se montrent inexorablement hostiles à certaines dispositions du protocole, notamment en ce qui concerne les questions entrant dans la compétence exclusive do
ne
l'Etat. L'autour est d'avis qu'on/pourra rien fa Lie en cette matière sans s'être assuré la collaboration des Stats-Jnis; en ce qui concerne lo désarmement naval, surtout, le Japon, l'Angleterre, la France et l'Italie, c'est-a-diro les pays qui ont déjà conclu avec, les Etats-Unis le traité de '.Washington, ne pourraient pas consentir à une nouvelle limitation à laquelle les Etats-Unis n'auraient aucune part, Considérant les démarches faites l'an dernier par le président COOLIDGE, en ce qui concerne la convocation d'une conférence du désarmement, l'auteur est amené à croire à la non-participation des Etats-Unis à la conférence do la Société des Nations.
Devant cette éventualité probable, M. G A?. Y U GAJTJJIiJ ponse que les grandes puissances seront obligées de s'entendre préalablement avec les Etats-Unis quant à la question du désarmement naval, non pas à la Conférence do Genève, mais à la Gonférenco qui sera convoquée à Washington par les Etats-Unis.
Cependant, au cas où la Conférence de Genève ne serait pas convoquée, ou si elle échouait, les Etats-Unis devraient convoquer immédiatement une conférence qui n'aurait pas qualité pour discuter du désarmement terrestre, car
5 -
pour le désarmement terrestre, il est de première nécessité 6 ’ tvoir collaboration de le France; or, le France s'est toujours opposée énergiquement à un ô és armement militaire, et si elle a récemment accueilli favorablement une proposition cie ce genre, c’’est pvree ou’elle considère eue le Protocole >e Genève g rantit sa sécurité, ji donc, le Protocole, était rejeté ou s'il restait lettre morte, écrit l'auteur, comment pourrait-on espérer eue 1 s. France se mêlerait à une pareille aventure ?
l'auteur préconise enfin la convocation de deux conférences: l'une serait convoquée our la société des Notions en vue de discuter du désarmement /terrestre et l'autre, par les Etats-Unis, pour le désarmement naval.
"OJAILi A-jeïïI" du ô janvier se montre partisan du protocole; il écrit que le sort réservé au protocole décidera de la réalisation de la. paix internationale, «¿ans le protocole et par conséquent, s ans la conférence du désarmement, il n'v aura p ..s de nais; il importe de dire que le succès du protocole ot de la conférence du désarmement dépend principalement de l'attitude de l'Angleterre et des Et ts-Unis. L'auteur voit avec pessimisme - comme beaucoup d'autres journaux, - que le Cabinet actuel de l'empire britannique fait de la. politique impérialiste, qui met obstacle au protocole. Pour mettre le protocole en vigueur, il faut, n .r conséquent des amendements sur les points qui rencontreraient -de l’opposition de 1part de l'Empire brit auuique, surtout du coté des dominions, c’est-à-dire qu'il f¿ut exclure les amendements japonais relatifs à la question de ls compétence exclusive de l'Etat. Dans ces conditions, le Japon ne pourrait pas signer le Protocole ainsi arèneé., car il serait cette fois, contraire au;: vues du Japon. L'auteur préconise pour résoudre ce dilemme internationale, une conférence traitant du problème de 1' émigration et de 1' immigration.
- b -
’’CHUG a I SHIOGYO” du 8 janvier examine 1’attitude que Xe Japon devrait prendre éventuellement, au sujet d’une conférence du désarmement, oui serait convoquée! non pas par la Société des Bâtions, tanis-u.tr les Etats-Unis i
Lf auteur est d *nvis qü’avant la p *rtidipation du japon à cette conférence, il faut résoudre toutes les questions pendantes entre les Et • ts-Unis et le Japon.
Plus loin, lorsqu’on publie une dépêche de Washington
iisant que le président COOLIDGE, désirerait convoquer une conférence âu désarmement, nuis qu ’il ne le fer it qu'après s’être assuré de l’attitude que prendrait la iociét é des Notions n cet effet, la -presse japonaise se range dn coté du. protocole et de la convocation d'une
conférence par la. société des Notions.
Il y ;i quelques articles dons les grands journaux, qui critiquent l’attitude des Etats-Unis pour augmenter sa force navale en même temps qu’ils proposent une conférence du désarmement.
’’OüAiCâ MAINICHI" du £7 janvier vs dus loin; il dit qu’une pareille conférence dans de telles circonstances ne pourrait aboutir à la paix véritable entre les nations du monde.
”O.J/iEâ AjAHI’’ du £6 janvier, dans son éditorial, accuse la tyramie des naissances fortes dans la. politique internationale, seule cause qui mettrait la Société des Nations en danger, car les fortes puissances sauront toujours agir comme elles l’entendentr quand il s'agit de la défense de leurs intérêts propres, même u préjudice de plus petites. L’auteur écrit que tant que cette tyrannie s'exercera , une. conférence du désarmement et le protocole pour le règlement pacifique ne serviraient arien.

Confidential Circular 5.1925. Geneva, March 20th, 1925,
THE SITUATION I IT AMERICA.
Geneva, Maroh 2nd, 1925.
hear Sir Eric,
During my two months' leave in the United States, I visited several of the largest cities and universities in the East, talked with many influential pro and anti-League people including Mr,Hughes, President Lowell, Mr, Tickersham, Professor Philip M, Brown,
Mr* J, /. Davis, Professor Shotwell, to m.ention only a few names, and spoke to more than fifteen different groups of people oonc rning the work of the League. I am writing to give you in "brief compass my chief impressions of the Situation there.
People generally, represented Lest perhaps "by the business man, are prosperous and satisfied with "the state of the nation", The task of handling national and foreign problems has been entrusted to President Coolidge in whose good judgment there is great confidence and with those conservative policy there is no desire to interfere*
The practical value to the United States of general inter nations, agreements which would result in restricting American liberty of action is not recognised as regards most questions. Distrust of Europe is rampant and deepseated, Egypt, Corfu, German Disarmament and Opium are cited as proof of insincerity in Europe and of the failure of the League, although, curiously enough, the League ha3 not been attacked very heavily for the "failure" of the Opium Conference/ There is a disposition to suspend consideration of the Protocol until if ever, it becomes an accomplished legal fact, The Court is accepto as a good thing, but the movement to push the Senate into action seems to lack political vitality.
This typical attitude is the result of traditional American policy, the after-effects of the Lodge-Yilson fight and the headlines of such sensational foreign news as get3 on the front page*-of the daily pres3( and I should add here that although foreign items are not in general prominently displayed, news from Geneva is certainly increasing in quantity).
Europe is far away- reports concerning the work of the League &re often conflicting- and people generally feel that it is not worth while to spend much time on such matters. They will prQbably listen attentively to a talk before an organisation to which they belong, or they may come out to hear a very prominent man on somev foreign topic, but they will not go much further,- a high official of one of the leading publishing houses in New York told me thpre wr.t
/no market for
-2-
serious books on foreign politics or international problems.
.¿meriouns are on the whole, however, "willing to be shown”.
The great unsolved problem is hew to command their attention,
The facts concerning the work of the League are not known -one of the highest officials (pro-League) of the federal Beservo Bank in hew York did not know of the Greek Refugee programme until he was told it by Mr, Norman two months ago; and judgements of League work based on sensational newspaper headlines, which are primerly responsible for such judgements, may go unrefuted for months or years because very few people will read further.
This is, I think, the situation as regards the publio generally. Certain powerful elements feel, however, that the United States has a decided responsibility for world conditions and greatly lament the present selfish and inactive policy of the Government, They are principally: the Churches, Women1 s Organisations and the Universities, as ’veil as various liberal groups not very well organised, The Conference in Washington in January of representatives of all the big national Women's Organisations to discuss ”tho causes and the cures of war" was vory significant of present-day tendencies among these groups., They have, however, no concrete programme exoept to "join the Court",
Public opinion is on the whole in a fluid state, willing to accept the leadership of the Government. Under the Harding-Coolidge administration progress was made towards the League, but I do not feel this was in any marked way due to the influence of Mr. hughes or that his departure will have any great effect upon the relations between the League and the United ¿States. It is not considered that Kellogg will last long or to be a "strong man' in the ¿state department. Senator Borah prefers to work for world peace outside the League. Whether he cun ever be persuaded to accept a policy of collaborut ion with the League in the political field seems doubtful. he is to meet with a group of various forward-looking leaders, including ohotwell, early this month, however, to discuss v/hat American foreign policy ought to be.
Moreover Mr. Borah no longer publicly attacks the League,
President Coolidge will control American foreign policy for the present, Mr, Borah cannot count on controlling even one-third of the Senate and may possibly aocept a policy of League collaboration favoured by Coolidge, even though he may not actively push it, The President, who is a hard-headed politician as well hs a practical idealist, cannot always talk about American interest in world peace, which, in ^meriou today, generally means disarmament *
in my opinion the development of American polioy at the present time is largely in the hands of the League itself. In order to guido that development in the direction of co-operation with Geneva it is necessary I feel to oarry through the general Rrotoool programme as nearly as possible as it was originally outlined. The agreement of the British Dominions ought to bo secured, however, and the plan for a Disarmament Conference ought by no means to be separated from the rest of the scheme. This should ensure American co-operation in the League's work for land disarmament in Europe - eventual co-operation in the security and arbitration features of the plan will depend on the success with which the scheme works in aotual cases. It is most important of all that the League should go ahoad in a business-like way with no "catering" of any kind to the United ¿States.
-3-
My impressions ere not. it is evident, optimistic end they do not contain anything very new. ns a mutter of fact i do not feel that the situation has changed very appreciably of late, particularly when I think of the situation as i saw it when I was at homo last - one and a half years ago. There seems to ho no particular movement in the country towards increased co-operation with or membership in the League, On the other hand, the country is certainly much more alive to world affairs than it was before tho War more willing to view tho League objectively than it was in 1919/20 and more ready than at any time sinoe the War to give the administration a free hand in the development of constructive leadership in the foreign field in viow of iimerioan membership in the family of nations, and the responsibility of the United otutes in consequence thereof.

A provisional arrangement has boon entered into with a Cinematograph undertaking which proposes each month

to produce a film doaling with the current activities of the Loaguc. This undertaking will be granted for a short period the exclusive right of taking cinomatograph pictures on tho promises of the Secretariat.
With regard to League activities here in Genova, tho Information Section will, of course, be most concerned with keeping tho firm au oourant, but it will be of considerable assistance if other Sections will co-operate in making suggestions from time to time.
It is, however, concerning features of League interest in other parts of the world whore the fullest co-operation will bo required to make a real success of this scheme. To this end, therefore, I should bo glad if all Sections of the Secretariat would bring to the notice of the Information Section at tho earliest possible moment any matters which they consider would be of interest to include in the "monthly League film" and so enable the firm in question to communicate -ith its various representatives abroad and thereby take full advantage of any special features arising from time to time in other parts of tho ,,rorld.

BE Lai IOi.o BDIWEED MEMBERS OP THE SECRETARIAT a lid m. msaiidiL.
I wish to draw the attention of all the Headg of Departments interested in matters of this kind, to a serious professional indiscretion committed by Mr. Hans Wosomann, Geneva correspondent of tho Sozial-Domooratischa J?a£lement arise he Korrospondcna of Berlin, in his relations with one of the members of the Information Section.
Although for reasons of general pres3 policy it was not thought wise to cut Mr. Wescmann off from the ordinary official information available to all ¡Journalists, or t o forbid him the entry to the Secretariat, I think it necessary that in the future officials of the Secretariat should uso tho greatest reserve in their relations with Mr. Wosemann.
It may be added for the information of the Secretariat, that the case in question wus brought to the notice of the Association of journalists and was severely censured by tho Committee of the Association.

THE INTEEPAEL IALIENTAIŸY CONFERENCE.
HEUOKANDUIi BY MR. SV/ÊETSEE AND CCU.iEFTS BYTES SECRETARY - GENERAL.
.omorahdum to
the Se ere tary - Gone ral.
The Interparliamentary Conference.
•	The XXIIIrd Intor-Parliaraentary Union Conference to be
held in Washington and Ottawa from October 1 - 13, is of exceptional importance, not only because it will bo attended with a lavishness and a publicity never before equalled, but because of certain new and serious political tendencies which seem to bo developing.
A series of indications from Washington seums to point to the fact that there will be a conscious attempt to create a divergent policy around the principle of “The Codification of International Law" , which may oven go so far as to attempt tho convocation of a Third Hague Conference. lost of those indications originate in sources inimical to the League of Nations, indifferent to tho permanent Court of International Justice and sceptical of tho v/orh of codifying international law as initiated by the League .
The formula for "the codification of international lav/* * has long been a ral lying-point for certain juridical and academic circles in the United States which, while bitterly hostile to tho League of Nations, have realised tint it was necessary to offer a substitute thoroxor. Those circles hi vo accordingly laid groat stress on the necessity of some such codification, especially as
I
2.
opposed—bo'tho~ Tsapposadly • dangerous ana distasteful "political” aspects of the League and have made on appreciable appeal to a notion which thinks very highly of legal and constitutional forms.
The most striking success of this group has boon in connection with the Pan-American liovomont, There, under the aegis of the Camogio Endowment for International peace and acting upon the resolution of Secretary of State Hughes, the Bureau of the Pan-American Union requested the American Society of International Law to make suggestions for n Committee of Jurists which is soon to meet in Hio Sanoiro for drafting a code. Those suggestions have just boon issued with considerable publicity in the United States.
This move for the codification of international law has gradually advanced further and further in American public life until recently President Coolidgo actually mentioned its desirability in ono of his speeches. Similarly, Senator Borah, Chairman of the foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, is largely basing his opposition to American participation in the permanent Court on the ground that international lav/ has not boon codified and . that a preliminary stop to any such membership must necessarily \ bo that codification.
Recently, when Senators ILchinlcy and Burton came to the mooting of the Bureau of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Paris they very strongly supported the suggestion that the forthcoming Conference in Washington discuss the codification of international law. Senator Burton even appeared to have in hie mind that the Washington Conference might quite possibly request the President of the United States, as the St. Louis Conference requested President noosevoit twenty-one years ago, to press for anothci meeting of the nations at The Hague.
3.
Shortly after, tho Paris edition of the HEW YORK HERALD printed-a Washington despatch to the same effect. Recent American papers show that considerable attention has been given to this question in the American Press. Ah important syndicate, under c\ate of April 2 3th, carried a column despatch from which the following loading paragraphs may bo taken:-
"In October, 1925, a definite movement will be launched here for the assembling of a third international peace congress on the linos of tho first and second Hague conferences of 1399 and 1907. The movement will be sponsored by the twenty-third conference of the Interparliamentary Union which is to be held in the Capitol of the United States at the invitation of President Coolidge and pursuant to a special act of congress .......
®It is exactly twenty-one years since the Interparliamentary Union last net in the United States. The occasion was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis. Tho union in tint year, 1904, took the initiative in steps that induced the late Gzar of Russia to call the second Hague Conference three years later.
"Union leaders hope and believe that history will repeat itself. They confidently expect the international public opinion which they will reflect at the Washington conference in October will lead to the assembling of another world peace congress, this time perhaps under American auspices. The purpose of a third congress would be to consider the whole problem of international law.**
On May 8th, the correspondent of the BOSTOIJ TRAIT SCRIPT egan another column despatch with the following:-
nIf the desires of a number of influential members of the organisation prevail, tho Interparliamentary Union which will meet in Y/ashingtai in October with the American section as host, will approve a resolution urging a new Hague conference to continue the work of the first two Hague conferoncos. The proposal is drawn up in a tentative resolution for the agenda of the conforonce. More than throe hundred parliamentarians from the principal nations arc expected at the October meeting, in the chamber of the House of Representatives.
4
4.
,zThe proposal is that the Interparliamentary Union re inaugurate, so to speak, the Hague Peace movement of 1904 and 1906; such a move, it is "believed, "being in accord with the traditional policies cf the United States in international affairs,. l‘he suggested resolution calls a third conference in continuation of the previous Hague conferences, for the following four purposes: first, to resirte the established rules of international law, especially in those fields affected by the events of the recent World War; second, to formulate and agree upon the amendments and additions, if any, to rules of international law shown to be necessary or useful by the events of the war and the changes in the conditions of international life and intercourse which have followed the war; third, to endeavour to reconcile divergent views and secure general agreement upon the rules which have been in dispute heretofore; fourth, to consider subjects not now adequately regulated by international lav/, but as to which the interests of international justice require that rules of law shall be laid down ana accepted.
’’’The proposed resolution will suggest also that the Third Hague conference be followed by another conference to continue unfinished business.
The President of the United States would be requested to invite all nations to send representatives. Proponents of the idea point out that it would be appropriate that the Interparliamentary Union, in its sec aid meeting in the United States, should follow the example set in its St. Louis •; meeting twenty-one years ago, at which time a resolution was adopted requesting the several governments of the world to send delegates to a second Hague conference. The reasons for this step, it is argued, are as timely today as they were when set forth in the preamble to the 1904 resolution. President Roosevelt acceded to the request of the resolution on the 1904 meeting of the Interparliamentary Union and the powers accepted the invitation presented, as in the invitation to the Hirst Hague Conference, by the Csar of Russia.
Out of this grew the program for the second Hague c anf eren ce .. ....
On the following day, the NEV/ YORK TILES, in another column despatch centering around substitutes for the League of nations and the permanent Court, wrote as follows:-
nA determined movement appears to be in progress with the object of inducing the Coolidge Administration to take a new line of endeavour to meet popular sentiment for American adhesion to the World Court and at the some time placate the anti-court feeling among Republican Senators.
5
“'It is be ing hinted that the administration is giving consideration to suggestion s from influential party sources that an effort be made to bring about an international agreement designed to amplify the powers of the permanent Court of International Arbitration at The Hague of which the United States is a member, so as to g:' /e to it the functions of a Court of Justice similar to those possessed by the Permanent Court of International Jusxico set up by the league of Hat ions.
" The movement for extending the powers of the Permanent Court of Arbitration is said to be in line with the policy enunciated by Senator Borah, Chairman of the Committee cn foreign Relations, and endorsed by Senators of the irreconcilable group, of codifying international law as a preliminary to American endorsement of or adhesion to any world court of justice........."
There would, therefore, seen to be no doubt but that there is a desire in certain limited but influential, quarters in the United States to create a new movement for the codification of international law with the objective of a Third Eaguo conference. Assuredly, Senator Borah, as Chairman of the foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, certain Republican Senators opposed to the League of Hations, certain elements ox the Carnegie foundation, and some of tha officials of the American group in the Interparliamentary Union, are in favour of this result.
Undoubtedly, therefore, European parliamentarians who are going to Washington should be familiar with the situation before they leave. They shoull have chance to > consider all tho implications of such a movement and to have some definite policy in connection therewith. They should
6 .
recognise, too, that they will he received in the United States with a lavishness and a publicity such as they have never had in Europe; that they vail be the guests of the Government throughout their trip; that they will have what is an unprecedented courtesy of being able to use the Halls of Congress for their meetings; that their proceedings will be recorded in the greatest detail; and that, finally, after being the guests of the Government in Washington, they will be the guests of the Carnegie Endowment in New York.
There can be little doubt, however, that a proposal for a Third Hague Conference would constitute a very wide departure from the present direction of international politics. It would in effect be equivalent to sweeping aside a good deal of the international organisational work done since 1907 and going back to the old methods. Two particular divergencies might be mentioned
Hirst, o Third Hague conference would be entirely off the line of the League of Nations movement.	It would mean the abandonment, even if
only temporarily, of the system of permanent, organised, treaty-regulated co-operation, in favour of a very loose,

irregular and un organ lea! co-operation,,
Second, it would mean an attempt at a global codification of international lav/, i,e. the drafting of a code instead of the system adopted by the League in practice and approved by the leaguevs Jurists1 Commission, of progressive codification subject by subject as each question reaches maturity.
Other elements of the Conference also call for very serious consideration, especially from certain of the technical organisations connected with the League of Nations, Accordingly, it might be quite proper to give herewith the full agenda of the Conference:
1, Election of the President and of the Bureau of the Conference,
2„ General Debate on the Secretary General*s Report,

According to Art, IS of the Statutes the retiring member is not eligible for re-election and his place must be filled by a member belonging to another Group.
9.>
From this Agenda it is clear that certain questions are to he discussed which are as present being given detailed consideration in Europe., The following mey he mentioned:
(1} 11 His CRIUINALITY OF UARS OF AGGRESSION (OUTLAWRY OF WAR’}”
brings ftp many of the questions involved in the Protocol,
LAidou'btelly. the maximum of pregross that is preoticahlo at the pa-esent moment on this subject will be made at the forthcoming Assembly of the league of Nations. Accordingly, it would be in the best interests of all if someone who had talon part in those discussions could go to Washington«
(2)	"ETTROEEASf CUSTOMS UNDEIhSTAKHNG?!
brings up many enactions which were din.nissed at the recent Crustoidb Gonri'erenos of the League ox hat cone and at varxens other technical meetings held by that body. If thin question is no", to be entirely general ana academic it would seam again in the best interests of all if provision were u»da for someone to go to Washington who had taken part in this work,
Co) T“IHE PROBLEM OF NATIONAL MJNCRIF IlEU1
brought up the most serious difficultias at the last Conference and was indeed made the basis of a violent cssf W«o&g£8 reference in che liepcrt ox the Secretary of. the American Croup to that Conference. Without doubt, there are pari lams ut ariana in different countries who could present a fair view of this difficult problem and prevent the Conference from being swept off its feet by discontented alements0 This would seem especially desirable in a country so- -mw3«ptibl3, as ft the United «States., to this kind of appeal.,
(4) WTHB FIGHT AGAINST PAKGEEOUS DRUGS”
will naturally bring up the mart serious questions in Washington in view of the rather sensational withdrawal of the American Delegation from the recent Opium Conference called by the League of Nations,. Undoubtedly, anything that is said on this question till have the very widest publicity so that it is most decidedly in the interests of the other Governments, particularly the British, French and Patch, that this matter be adequately and fairly presented,
(5) «THE REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS"
is another Question that could. hardly bo alccpaiel.y handled except through some direct contact with those who have taken part in the Arms Traffic Conference at Geneva and the Sixth Assembly. Undoubtedly, progress will bo mala oa the two specific quest5ens mentioned 'NOemilitarised hones” and "Plans and lie t hod for the Reduction of Armaments",
10
There would seem, therefore, to he no dcubt hut that the European parliamentarians who have planned to go to Washington this Pall ought to he thoroughly familiar with the negotiations and conferences which have already taken place on the various subjects in Europe and that they ought to appreciate the various political possabilities of the Conference*
11
, ,r0 01j G G T .
I entirely agree that the Parliamentarians attending the Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Washington and Of tana should go to Washington with as full knowledge as pessihle of what the League has done in the various fields which fall within the agenda of the Conference *
. On the other hand, we ought not, of course, to take a definite line of opposition to any of the proposals which are made. I myself do not believe that they wall have bad results for the League unless, of course, those who are discussing thorn are animated by definitely hostile intentions. For instance, there is the question of a further Hague Conference.
If it -wore generally confined to the items set out in the despatch from the ^Boston Transcript'' I would not seo any reason for opposing it. According to that despatch, its main purpose would be to draw up new' rules of international law as concerns warfare . This is a question which I have always felt ought not to be dealt with by the League, and I should be quite glad to see the onus of treating it fall on someone else.
Further, we ought not to appear in any way worried by this Conference. I do not know how' representative will be the delegates from certain countries, but according to precedent the British representation is not likely to be very influential.
I doubt whether, unless this particular meeting is of a very different character to previous ones, the recommendations which the Union may make will carry any great
12.
weight with, the respective Governments, At the sene time, I clo thin;: thet v;o should do everything v/o can to ensure that as many Pariiarr.cntaria.ns as possible who £0 to Ur. shin ¿ten will have knowledge of and will be prepared to speak in favour of the League and its work.
I agree that the memorandum prepared by you and this minute, should be circulated -confidentially to the various Directors end Chiefs of Sect loos, risking them to ascertain, if possible, the names of those vho are going from their own country and to do all that is possible in the sense I have outlined above. Of course it is equally advisable to try to get well known league supporters to go to take part in the- Conference.

1. I think that a on c members of tho ¡Secretariat nay be interested in having sene recent observations concerning the progress of opinion in tho United States of America with respect to tho League of Hat ions and the general problem of international co-operation. I therefore bog to bo permitted to set forth what follows:
United
It must not be supposed that States is a static one, ho wove
tho situation in tho r difficult it nay soon
from this side of tho Atlantic to discern changes which arc taking place. If, during tho last G -’cars, there has boon a constant appearance of diffidence on the part of tho Government of the United *Jt- tes, it would bo a mistake, to conclude that either governmental or general opinion in the United States has not passed through numerous phases of change and development.
In a country which spreads over 3,000 miles of territory, inhabited by 115,000,000 of people vfco have no common newspaper, and whoso economic and cultural interests vary widely, there can be no such thing as constancy or singleness of purpose, and it is only possible for one with wide and fresh cm tacts among the people to draw deductions which may serve as bases for tentative conclusions. Uvon so, tho conclusions can harclly bo formula tod until they have become obsolsto and lost much of their value. It is subject to this condition that I would submit my
hamblo observations.
3.	After tho creation of tho Permanent Court of International Justice it was inevitable that tho problem of co-opera ting in its
e
maintenance* should engross the attention of the American public*. The delegates of the Initod States at tho first Hague Conference in 1899 actively cel lab orated in sotting up the permanent Con rt ox .ai eitrotion, anr oho deleg.-tos of the United States at tho Second Hague Conference in 1907 stood out steadfastly for the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitral Justice, Tho successful crcatim of the Pcrnanont C0urt of International Justice in 1920 ohf llongod American admiration thoroforo , and in view of tho largo number of poo pi o whoso advocacy of a League of nations had sprung vory largely from tho ir desire for cn international court, 1 think it was never possible for us to prevent tho question of the Court fren engaging attention in America as a separate question from that of co-oeoration in the League of nations.
4„ The Permanent Court of International Justice is known in America as tho "World Court." This appellation is partly due to the do sir 0 for a short name. . It has served good purpose* in widening the conception of the Court as a universal institution, Tho term was not invented by tho specie. 1 friends of tho Courtf but it is now opposed by. tho enemies of tho Court, who insist that, because of the abstention of Germany and Russia and a. few other countries, tho .Court is not in any re;-}, sense a world court.
5. Prior to the proposal for adhesion by President Harding on February 24th, 1923, there was little general discussion of the Court in America, and its statute was not rnuah studied.. In fact there* was hardly a half dozen of people who wore writing -d) out it. After President Harding's proposal the structure of tho Court came to bo widely discussed.. Tho opposition first centred on the connection between the Court and the League. This called for elaborate explanations by friends of the Court and supporters of President Harding's pro posal. Those o replan ati ms were successful, however, and to-day there is no longer apprehension, about tho connection between the Court and the League•
« I v
jho opposition then t x>k tip the question of so-called "compulsory jurisdiction," and advocates of the outlawry of war found the Court unacceptable because of its limited jurisdiction» Lloregyvof, certain followers of Hr. Root resent ocl the fact that tho First Assembly made a change in this rospoct in tho draft of the Advisory Committee of Jurists; but it has now cone to be perceived that the United States would probably be loss willing than otier countries to confer cprovisory jurisdiction on the Court, and this argument has thereof ore lost much of its force. Various suggestions came to bo made, also, that tho election ox tho judges should ho taken away from the C0uncil and Assonbly of the loaguo of Hat ions , and. these suggestions wore partly duo to a hangover of tho notion that, in. the Assembly, the United States would have hut one vote to tho seven of \ho British Umpire * Tho admission of Ireland has reduced the appeal of this notion, arxL it is now generally perceived that no important change can bo made in tho structure of tho Court err in tho method of selecting tho judges, without impairing the very existence of tho Court. An objection was also made that tho Court was powerless, bccauso Intornational Law had not been codified for its administration - this tied up with the popularity of a gonoral insistence on tho codification of International Law. But the creation by tho League of Rations of tho Committee for the Progressiva Codification of International Law has greatly aided in getting i’id oi this objection«
6.	At tho present time tho opposition to the Court depends chiefly on the personality of Bona tor Borah, who has a powerful position in the United States by reason of his general appeal to independent opinion and by reason of his chairmanship of tho Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate.
Senator Borah has never boon out of the United States, except, possibly, into Canada. Ho was a violent opponent of tho league
to work in 'behalf of a botter
rf Notions and bo professes always international order than tho League symbolizes. Ho was violently oncitod by the Protocol of Genova, which ho char -ret i or i zed to mo as the greatest militarist document ever penned. Ho openly denies that ho is bound by the position of the Republican Party with respect to the Court. Being always an opposition man, even when his Party is in power, ho finds it necessary to have arguments with which to lead opposition to the Administration's policy.
Ho has shifted from one argument to another with respect to tho Court. Ho sens the Court mainly in terms of his conception of the Supreme Court of the United States, and he seizes with avidity on any difference between tho Supreme Court of the United States aid the Permanent C0urt of International Justice, always to the
detriment of the latter.
7,	At the present tine Senator Borah centres his argument on tho power of the Permanent Court of International Justice to givo advisory opinions to tho Council ancl Assembly of tho league .
The Supremo Court of the United States onereisos no such power, and Senator Bp rah readily/ ac copied Hr. Root’s and Judge John Basset I.Iooro’s original opinion that the giving of advisory opinions is not a part of the judicial function. In eon sequence Senator Borah finds that in giving advisory/ opinions tho Permanent Court of International Justice acts as the legal adviser of the Council of the League, or, as ho says, as its Attorney-General.
Ho finds the Court to bo subjected, t hero fare . to tho political domination of tho Council, and ho thinks it o/rtremely dangerous for the United States to support a court which, instead of being an independent judicial institution, is merely a tool of a political body with which ho would not be willing to deal.
0- During the past two months there has boon considerable danger that President Coolidgc would c onpremise with Senator Borah. In an address to Congress last winter President Coolidgo repeated
5 **
his approval of President Landing's propose!}. that the United States adhere to tho Court Protocol, adding a condition that advisory opinions of tho Court should not hind tho United States. If President Coolidgo should compromise with Senator Borah, the compromise) would take the form of his agreeing that tho Government of tho United States would propose to tho Governments hound by tho Protocol of tho Court that tho Courts power to render advisory opinions bo abolished altogether. 1 have repoatodly stated that, in my judgment, the other Governments of tho world would bo unwilling to accept so.oh a proposal, and I think it most important that opinion in other countries should stand adamant against the abolition of the power of tho Court to give advisory opinions* Jkn inti-iato advisor of President Coolidgo, upon whom tho President frequently doponds in such matters, has lot it be known that, in his judgment, the other Governments of the world would ho vailing to accept such a proposal made by tho United States. During tho past month we have conducted a
porsistont campaign with this adviser of tho President to persuade him that advisory opinions arc essential to tho now proeoss of pacific settlement inonguaratod by tho League of Nations. I have been informed sinco my arrival in Geneva that these offorts have not boon without result, and it now appears that this advisor has talked with tho President and, for the moment, at any rate, the President is dotorninc-d that no conpremise will bo made with Senator Borah on this point*
9.	Pho Senate of tho United States has set down tho discussion of tho Court proposal in its Calendar for Docambor IVth, 1925. I look forward to a battle royal at that time. Senator Borah will continue his opposition and will spend the intervening months appealing to tho country. Ho will load a
movonont which will take tho form, not of open opposition to
action by tho United States, but to tho framing of alternative proposals. I think it will be possible for the active friends
-fi-
ef the League in the United States
to bo brought to stand pat on the
proposals of President Raiding, as added to bp President Coolidge^ They will greatly need support from abroad, however, and it seems to me most essential that people in other countries should not encourage a belief in America that they would be willing to re-organise the Court along different lines. It is impossible to predict what will happen next winter. I should not be surprised if action is long delayed. One factor which makes action necessary is the by-elections in the United States in 1926. At that time members of Congress and one-third of the members of the Senate come up for re-election. In spite of this fact, however, there may be no final decision with reference to the Court, and some of us are now engaged in America in having people see that this question is important only for the United States; that the rest of the world has little to gain from • ction by the United States with reference to the Court; that it is better that the United States should delay action than that the gains already achieved by the world should be lost as a
consequence of radical changes in the Court's structure.
10.	It ought to be appreciated that, in spite of its relative insignificance, the Court question constitutes a hurdle on the road of the United States towards the League of Rations. It is impossible to talk about favourable action with reference to the League until the	Court question has been got	out of the way. I	do not
mean to indicate	that, in my opinion,	action	with reference to	the
League will be easier after the_ United States gives its support to . the Court. I am.	confident that for a	period	it will bo more
difficult, for a	vast body of opinion	in the	United States will be
satisfied with the action taken with reference to the Court and will therefore cease to press for more important action to be taken wi 1h
reference to the League itself.
-7-
11,	As to the league of Nations, opinion in America has not perceptibly improved during the last 12 months. The Protocol found its ndvooatesm. but it did not arpeal to the friends of the outlawry of war. UBff or tuna tely there were features of the Protocol which soem.ed to justify oertain fears entertained in America with respect to the Covenant itself. This is particularly true of those provisions which looked toward the use of force against an aggressor, It was not uncommon, therefore, for staunch advocates of the League o± Nations to say that the effect of the Protocol was to intensify arguments made against the League itself. Moreover, the proceedings of the Assembly at the time of drafting the Protocol had a bad press in America, end this was particularly true of the so-called Japanese Amendment. Then the attitude of the British Government was much over-played, and the net effect of the whole Protocol incident was to make advocacy of the League somewhat more difficult.
12^ Moreover, the withdrawal of the American Delegation from the Opium Conference, while stoutly resented in certain quarters, had the net effect of producing in the public mind an uneasiness which hag. not been allayed. The violent attacks on the attitude of various European Governments, as expressed during the Opium Conference, have fed this uneasiness, and in spite of our efforts to have people see that an advance has been achieved in the new Opium Treaty, there is relatively little enthusiasm to-day, even among persons interested in the opium traffic, for action by the United States with reference to the new Treaty.
13.	The Arms Traffic Conference re-assured the American public to some extent and, coming so soon after the Opium Conference, had the excellent effect of accustoming the public mind to looking to Geneva as the seat of international co-operation in the future.
14.	In fact the American situation has progressed to such an extent that I think it will no longer be necessary for the
-8-
jimerican Government to camouflage the cooperation which it undertakes The device of "unofficial observer" may have served a purpose in its day, hut its day is now past. During the presidential campaign of last autumn Mr. Hughes found it possible to justify his own position by pointing with pride to the amount of co-operation which he 1 had been able to initiate, and I think that in the immediate'-.-future it is probable that substantial ad hoc co-operation by the Government of the United States will be somewhat more enthusiastically and openly undertaken than during the 2 or Shyears past.
15.	Yet it must be admitted that even in quarters where enthusiasm for American membership in the league has been greatest in the past, a certain apathy has now come to exist. Most of the friends of the league are no longer as vigorous as they were. The country has come to see that the world did not come to an end with American abstention from the league. The whole problem has Ifcst its acute character, and people who have advocated the fullest international co-operation are now finding it somewhat difficult to chart their course.
16. The progress of events has come to be recognised, however, and since two years ago, or even a year ago, it is the record of the league, rather than the idea itself that is on trial. To be sure the record is little understood in most quarters, and yet the more intelligent people have come to appreciate that a record does exist.
I think one can say that intellectuals generally have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake for the United States to stay out of the league. Consequently there have been some notable reversals of " attitude. Journals which have previously been lukewarm are now supporting the league; but they are mostly journals of opinionyrather than journals of popular taste. Death, also, has made its ravages among the ranks of irreconcilables, and the number of public men whose faces must be saved, who find it difficult to square their past contentions with the living facts, yearly grows smaller,ho that
the whole problem of the League is coming to be faced somewhat more honestly and frankly than in the past,
17,	It must be recognised, however, that the problem has lost its urgency for most people in America. No party is willing to risk its fortunes on the issue of the League of Nations, and both of tho principal Partins are rather inclined to admit President CoolidgeTs dictum that it is a closed incident, This had the advantage of removing the problem from the sphere of party differences.
18.	At the present time a few irreconcilables are left -a few so-called radicals still press for their redolent programs which neither the Unites States nor any other country would undertake a few venerable defenders of the Hague Conferences remain,(the wind hos largely been taken out of their sails by the action of the League with reference to codification) but the American public which is interested at all in international affairs - and this does not include the masses of the voters- has come to tolerate the League, to look upon it with benevolence, and to be willing to hold a watching brief for the future. If action is taken with reference to the Court if the co-operation already begun can be continued, I look to see
a steady development of favourable opinion. Only a cataclysm, heweverm or an improbable revival, would put the United States in the League in the immediate future. I am satisfied that! an independent course pursued by other nations in their development of the League, of Nations will most contribute to the shaping of American opinion, in the end it will be the League’s success that will enable the ' United States to play her part,

COSIENT OH MB. SUEETSHR'S liEMGRAND III C ONCER HUG THE 2 2 HU COHERENCE OF TEE IN TER -P AS LI ALIEN TA R Y UNION TO BE HELD IN ■JaSHJBGTOIT IN OCTOBER 1925.
1,	I entirely share Mr. Sweotsor *s apprehension vm th reference to the forthcoming meeting of the Interparliamentary Uhion at »Washington, i'rom the point of view of people in America interested in the League of Nations, the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is a threatening menace. It is not that anything can be done by the Union of any consequence. . The menace lies in the fact that, with the publicity which will be given tc it, the meeting of the Interparliamentary Union will bo a canard which will deflect public opinion and create an illusory conception of possible international co-operation by the United 1tates through the Inter - 'tar liament ary Union as an alternative to the League of Nations.
2.	I think the danger lies in the iact that the nature of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is being and will be misrepresented to the American public, and the program which has been laid out for it will tend to revive the insistence in certain quarters of America on a meeting of a third Peace Conference at the Hague. It must not be forgotten that many people in the United States are trying to square their consciences with reference to the League of Nations by finding alternative measures of co-operation for the United States.
The public generally do not understand the significance of different international bodies, and a persistent attempt has been made recently to exaggerate the importance of the /
Inter-Parliaaeatary Union. Uninforq^4 PQPple are already ‘saying that the Permanent Court of International Justice, plus the Inter-Parliamentary Union furnish the agencies for co-operation by the United States.
3.	I think i.here is less danger in the discussion of the codification of international las. The existence of the League of nations Commission has become thoroughly familiar to the American public, and to some extent the demand for codification has been satisfied. The Inter-Parliamentary Union can do little, in my judgment, to push along the codification movement, and
I think its efforts are not likely to have much effect on American opinion in this direction.
4.	Mr, 3weetser is perfectly right, however, in saying that an attempt will be made to tie up the discussion of codification before the Inter-Parliamentary Union with the demand for a third Hague Conference, and here lies the danger in America. I greatly doubt whether any third Hague Conference is possible. I doubt even more whether it could accomplish any useful result if it were held, but from the point of view of Americans interested in the League of nations, the calling of such a conference, or even encouragement to the idea, would be most unfortunate.
5.	This being true, it seems to me essential that every possible effort should be made to have parliamentarians visiting the United States from Europe aware of the danger, and determined not to aggravate it. I have read the Secretary General’s comment on Mr. Sweetsex * s memorandum, and it leaves me somewhat in doubt as to how fax people here may go. I am inclined to think, however, that it would serve a most useful purpose if some of the people going to America could be more thoroughly informed oh the situation. Would it not be possible for
hr. Lange, and even some of the delegates, to be approached/
— o —
informally, in order to make sure that they appreciate this phase of tho situation. I realise the danger signalised by the Secretary-General, but it would seem to no possible to avoid it, and, at the sane tine, to have various people approached, with a view to their better realisation of tho use which certain people in America propose to make of the Inter-Par 1 i amentary Union with a view to domestic effect in the United otates.
6.	It is certainly possible, with the proper direction, that the Conference should be made to result in increasing the prestige of the League in America. Kr. 3weetser has pointed out the degree to which the agenda of the Conference hinges upon the activities of the League of Nations. If European parliamentarians would give emphasis to this feature of their work, they could render great service in North America. One could permit himself go hope that some of them would find it possible to describe and explain the work of the League of Nations in connection with each item on their agenda. But the enemies of the League in America will be only too ready to put forward their critical views, and, if permitted, they will seise the Conference as a forum from which to attack the League and to emphasise the possibility of alternatives.
It seems to me important, therefore, that no opportunity now be lost to have the parliamentarians from other countries appreciate this danger.

la Chambre internationale de Commerce a tenu à Bruxelles, du 20 au 26 juin, son troisième Congrès. les précédents étaient à Londres en 1911 et à Kome an 1923*
Je crois utile de donner ci-dessous quelques impressions générales sur le congrès et quelques renseignements sur les questions qui intéressent spécialement la Société des î’ations
I. CbTSR-lLITES.
le personnel qui a pris part au congrès était extrêmement considérable. La liste des délégués ne comporte pas moins de 727 noms, et l’on peut7”estimer que, malgré les absences, il y avait au moins 600 membres, parmi lesquels une délégation compact o de plu3 de 200 Américains*
le congrès a invité, en dehors de ses membres proprement dits, des représentants des organisations internationales, une trentaine environ. Parmi ceux-ci figuraient au complet tous les membres du comité de transfert du plan Lamies, des représentants de l’Union internationale des chemins de fer, de l’international lav? .Association, du Bureau international du Travail, etc.
le congrès avait pu s’assurer la collaboration d’un certain nombre de personnalités très en vue, telles que Sir *rthur cal four, sir Alan .Anderson (Grande-Bretagne), Sir J as i ah

Lors de la Séanoe dTouverture du congrès, présidée par le Roi des Belges, il. Janssen, membre du Comité financier de la Société des Rations, a parlé en qualité de Ministre des finances de Belgique.
„1 la fin du congrès, a. lïillis Booth, Président sortant, a été remplacé par M. Tlalter leaf, Président de la Westminster Bank o
II. Pirelli présidait un des trois groupes techniques,, à savoir le groupe finances: . Le Comité de la restauration écono^ mique traitait les questions les plus générales* Les trois rapporteurs de ce Comité, qui ont présenté des travaux ûTune grande valeur, étaient 3ir Josiah Stamp, II. Pirelli et 11., de Chalendar ( qui ont tous trois fait partie de divers comités de la Société des Rations depuis 1922<>)
ÎI* de Chalendar a présenté une brochure intitulée -"Les progrès de la restauration économique", dans laquelle il étudie les finances publiques dans les principaux Ptats de 1T dur op e depuis 1920, et le commerce extérieur et la politique douanière.
Sir Josiah Stamp, H. Pirelli et il. de Chalendar ont présenté un rapport sur le paiement des réparations et 1’avenir du commerce international.
La question des transferts a été étudiée dans le document que- je viens de citer, et a fait aussi l’objet aTun exposé de 3ir Josiah Stamp*

les délégués do plusieurs Etats de 1’ fur ope centrale, notamment le Docteur Eeisch, pour lr lutriche, ont fait des exposés sur la situation économique et financière de leurs pays.
le Comité de la restauration économique a présenté au Congrès et fait adopter des résolutions qui traitent successive-ment du plan Dawes, du problème des transferts, de l'améliora-|tion des conditions économiques, d3s dettes interalliées, des irohibitions dTentrée et de sortie, et du rétablissement de la >aix et de la confiance générales,

II	» QUESTIONS IHTBSESS/Jïr SPECIAL ELI ET T LA SOCIETE DES ÎUÏIQTS.
l) Résolutions du Comité de- la Kestauration économique,
En ce qui concerne le problème des transferts, l'exposé Eait devant le congrès par Sir Arthur Seltor, et qui s'est ¿placé immédiatement après celui de Sir Josiah Stamp, a montré que la Société des Dations avait ouvert la voie au plan Dawes on oc qui concerne les précautions à prendre pour les transferts.,
Il :j notamment insisté sur le fait eue le fl en de restai ~ rat ion de la Hongrie renferme le germe de 1* organisât ion qui a ét ' prévue dans le plan Dawes pour l'-a llanagne , la résolution b) du Comité de restauration signale que le progr's vers l'équilibre budgétaire a résulté jusqu'ici de l'accroissement des charges fiscales plutôt que d'économies. H est permis de penser que le congrès s'est inspiré des remarques faites depuis un an ou deux par le Comité financier au sujet de l’Autriche et de la Hongrie,
H& résolution 6 du Congrès attire l'attention sur les tarifs excessifs, les réglementât ions douanières déraisonnables et les restrictions arbitraire concernant les transports, toutes matières qui sont actuellement traitées par la Société des Hâtions*

Memorandum by the Financial Director
The Financial Director wishes to draw the attdntion of Directors and Heads of Services to the appended statement. It is important that those responsible for incurring expenditure should keep well informed as to the amounts still available, in order that credits may not be exceeded. Where further details are desired they will be iurnished, on demand, by the Financial Administration. It should not be forgotten that the Council Meeting in December affords the last opportunity for a transfer from one item in thé budget to another item.

Current contributions received in ten months of 1925 were 15,947,843.36 gold francs as. against 18,221,107.31 gold francs in 1924.
General travelling expenses for the first ten months of 1924 came to 139,741.79. For the c&rfesponding period of 1925 they amount to 188,752.43 f'rs. The appropriation was originally 225,000 frs. which the Council has increased to 265,000 fcs. Even with this increase, care will need to be exercised to keep within the budgetary limits.
The "general frais fund" was drawn upon during the first ten months of 1924 to the extent of 30,509.22 gold francs. Por 1925 this figure has been kept down to 21,472.95 gold franca. To this expenditure, however, should be added commitments amounting to 2400 fcs.
Miscellaneous revenuos, in aid to Chapter II amounted to 240,834.91 gold francs in 1924. They total 476,412.25 in 1925.

Confidential Circular 22. 1925 -December 12 th 1925.
Secrétaire général
a propos de la note que vous m’avez communiniiée récemment au sujet d'une conversation avec le Consul d’Allemagne, je voudrais vous présenter les observations suivantes:
La traduction des documents dans une langue autre nue le fronçais et l’anglais n'est peut-être pas seulement une question de dépens es.
Eh fait il me semble que cette question a été réglée prr le § 5 de l'article 16 du règlement intérieur de l'Assemblée oui déclare que:
" Tout Membre de le Société ou tout groupe de Membres peut demander que régulièrement tous les documents et publications de la Société soient traduits, imprimés et distribués dans une langue autre que le français ou l'anglais, à la condition d'y pourvoir lui-même”.
Cet article me paraît s'appliouer incontestablement ''ux documents que le Consul d’Allemagne voudrait qu'on communique en allemand à son gouvernement .
Le règlement de l'assemblée d'ailleurs vertu de son article 28, par décision de 1'
peut être modifié, assemblée, prise à 1
eu
majorité des voix, après rapport d'une commission.
Il me semble donc que, dans la situation actuelle, le règlement de rassemblée s'oppose à toute communication officielle de docu-
ments en une autre langue que le de la ¡Société des Hâtions.

Thank you for calling my attention to this, but is it not only
applicable to Assembly documents and publications? I1 he rules of
procedure for the Assembly cannot affect matters outside the Assembly.
(Initialled) 10. D.
20.11.25.
SLCBET-tiEL. Cli3SR.,h «
lenève, le 20 novembre 1925»
Je m’excuse de revenir sur la question de la traduction des documents en langue allemande, et je ne voudrais p.^s avoir l’air d’interpréter subtilement les articles du Règlement de 1’assemblée, mais, néanmoins, j’attire votre attention sur les points suivants^
1°) l’article 16 du Règlement de 1 ’..ssembl ée traite de 1.. question des langues à l'Assemblée dans les paragraphes 1, 2, 3 et 4e Il est évident que le paragraphe 5 ne s'applique pas seulement aux documents de 1’Assemblée, parce ou'il y est dit expressément qu’il s'agit de tous les documents et de toutes les publications de le Société des Nations et de leur traduction régulière»
” Any member of the league, or any group of Members, . may require that all documents and publications of the league shall be regularly tr an slated into, and printed and circulated in, a language other than French and English, but shall in such case defray all the necessary expenses»”
Je crois qu’à défaut de tout autre teate, si la demande àlle-mande était un jour posée, on pourrait envisager que, pour le moins, le cinquième paragraphe de l'article 16 constitue une orientation.
Pour mémoire, je vous sign; le également l'article 39 du
qu i
Règlement du Statut de la Corn /fut arreté par lr Commission de la Société des Nations et qui 'prescrit nue les langues officielles de la Cour sont le français et l’anglais,

It is certainly a most in to res moaning is as you suggest, but I like Dr. Van Hamel’s opinion as Assembly rules of procedure very
ting contention, and the full am still doubtful. I should he followed the drafting of the c 1oscly.

Article 16 of the Rules of Procedure of tho Assembly.
The fifth paragraph of Article 16 of tho Rales of Procedure of the ~ssombly was introduced (at a Sub-Committee of the ïirst Committee of tho First Assembly), in order to giro satisfaction, to a certain entent, to the Spanish-spoaking delegations, and in consideration of which they withdrew their original proposal to make Spanish a third official language.
Th© provision has been placed in Article 16, which applies to Assembly meetings only, but it is obvious that the rule itself was intended to apply to all the documentation sent out by tho League,, and not to be limited to documents published only during tho Assembly.
The tent of the rule expresses this clearly enough,
and so did the Rapporteur, M. Perraris, in his report presented
to tho Assembly on November 30th, 1320, in which he says: .
”.....nous avons résolu de donner a chamo représentant
la faculté de s'exprimer dans la langue çga'il préfère, a condition qu'il so charge do faire traduire son discours soit on fronçais, soit on anglais.
"En outre, tout pays peut décider do faire circuler dans sa propre languo los documents publics par la Société
"Le règlement prévoit ces deux possibilités et on mettant ohaque pays star un pied de parfaito égalité, permet a tous les mombros de la Société do faire publier los documents dans telle languo qu'il lour plaira; mais pour des raisons évidentes do convonanco et do dépense, chaque représentant <ûu ohaquo membre de la Société àovra pourvoir à la traduction et à la publication (Article 16).”
The conclusion is, therefore, that, although one would soarcoly have looked for this kind of rule in Article 16
r
of the Assembly Rules of Procedure, tho rule itself has boon intended to cover tho whole field.
