The SECRETARY-JEKERA1 regretted that circumstances had made it necessary lor the Council at its resent session to hold two meetings daily, as this placed loo great a strain both on the Council members and the Secretariat. Otherwise the meeting had, he thought, been successful. Especially had the settlement of a number of minor Questions between Germany and Poland improved the general atmosphere, and this improvement had facilitated the treatment of Lithuanian quest ions.

V.
li. HAAS said that conversations were in progress between representatives of the Swiss Government and of the Secretariat regarding the setting up of the League wireless station.
He hoped that an agreement would be reached before the meeting of the Supervisory Commission, which would probably be held on February 5th.
VI.
In reply to a question by the SECRETARY-GSDEERAL,
Mr. BIEL3E said that the receipt of League contributions for the year 1929 showed a slight falling off in comparison with previous years. This was, however, chiefly cue to special circumstances, namely, an accidental delay in the payment of the Canadian contribution and the non-payment of the Argentine contribution.	There was no sign of art,' ap ms mi ng tendency for
the payment of contribution

The SECRETARY-GENERAL welcomed Dr. Racjmann back and stated that as his report would shortly be circulated the discussion of the results of his journey, which had been very fruitful, might be postponed to a future meeting. He explained that the printed document containing the Chinese proposals to the health Organisation was for the moment not to be distributed to States Members as the proposals would first be communicated to the Health Committee.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL explained that the Committee of Thirteen on the Administration of the Secretariat, the International Labour Office and the Court Registry had met, and had appointed the Secretary-General as its secretary. Only twelve members were present as M. Osusky had not found it possible to accept nomination. The Committee had decided to hold a further meeting on June 15th and had asked two members,
Senor Quinones de U on and Madame Kluyvver, to prepare reports on certain subjects. They would decide at their next meeting as to whether the minutes of their meetings should be communicated to the members of the League or not. The Secretary-General stated that in general the Committee desired conditions in the
C(
2
Secretariat to be improved, ’Without taking any decision as to pensions they had shown themselves favourable in principle, and had asked actuaries to consider various proposals and the expense involved;,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL stated that Ilr. Co lb an was sending reports from the Naval Conference in London, but that they did not contain much beyond the rerorts given in the Press,
Mr. Colban honed that the Conference would be over by the end of March and suggested that in that eventuality the Preparatory Committee might meet towards the end of May.
The SECBSTARY-GEN-JRAL called attention to the forthcoming Customs Truce Conference, which, he stated, had two aspects, one concerning a tariff truce and the other the drawing up of a programme of the economic work of the League for the next year or two. He considered the latter task at least as if not more important than the former.
In this connection Mr. LOTEDAY pointed out that eighteen delegations to this Conference would be headed by Cabinet Ministers in office. It was the first time that Ministers had met to discuss questions of economic policy.
Marquis ?ATJLUCCI DI CALBOLI SALOME, referring to the new building for the League, stated that drainage of the ground would begin next month« As regards the building in which the Assembly could be held this year, a committee had met to consider whether the Satiment Electoral should be used and had invited certain architects and acoustic experts to advise it.
The question of expense was also being examined. It was already clear that the Satiment Alectoral would be an improvement on the
Salle de la Reformation, from every point of view, but the matter of expense had not yet been settled.
The Supervisory Committee had under consideration demands for the provision of forty mere offices for the Secretariat. These were necessary, but the difficulty at present was to find the necessary funds,
II.	HAAS explained that negotiations with the Swiss Authorities regarding the organisation of wireless telegraphy were nearly at an end. Agreement had been reached on practically every point, to the satisfaction of both parties» There would be a guarantee for the capital that the League supplied, and the short-wave post would remain the property of the League while it was exploited by the Société Radio Suisse which would derive certain financial advantages. It was possible that the whole organisation might cost the League nothing, That would depend upon the amount of work passing through the station.
It was thought that the station might be ready to operate in the spring of 1931„
M. de BALL3R stated that the extraordinary session of the Mandates Commission would be held just before the June session of the Commission.
The SLCRPTARY-GSNPRAL announced that Mr. Meek, a Norwegian judge, whom the Council had nominated as a member of the Commission of Inquiry info the alleged existence of slavery in Liberia, had unexpectedly had to resign.
Dr. Christy, who had much experience of Africa, had accepted to take his wlace and would be leaving on fsbruary 21st,
The Council was be ing informed.	Mis nomination had
been male by tie President of the Council and of the
Raoporteur
4
■L>r. R&JCEMAN' stated that the Health Committee would meet on March 5th to consider the proposals concerning China.
The Commit too sent to India to study nalaria was back, after four months in the country. The mission had been extremely successful, although the Secretary, Professor Ciuca, had fallen seriously ill with malaria and one other member had also had malaria. Both had recovered. The Committee had been received with some reserve at first by the Indian Medical Faculty, but thanks principally to tho tact of the Chairman, Professor Schuffner, relations with the local authorities had eventually become excellent. The report of this Committee would not be discussed before the ordinary meeting of the Health Committee in May; it would probably give rise to considerable discussion on technical points. The Committee had been highly impressed with the efficioncy of the Research Institute in India but had made many proposals regarding the application of preventive methods. Hot much attention had been paid to the Committee outside professional circles.
Dr. Burent, who was investigating leprosy, was now in Siam. The Leprosy Commission had been invited to go to Japan, but some members wore unablo to go at present and so the visit had been postponed.
Dr. MacKenzie was going to Bolivia next month, in connection with the Bolivian Governments request for advice on sanitary organisation.
The SECRETARY-GHNBEjLL asked that all Sections should note that the Argentine in all League documents should oe treated formally as a Member of the League. On one occasion the Argentine had been left out.
5
The Secretary-General called the attention of the meeting to the proposal made by M, mercia regarding the preparation of a synopsis showing the action taken by the various Members of the league in league questions. The Secretary-General thought that it might be very useful to keep a record of the action taken by the different States on Circular letters sent to them. Such a record would be for use only within the Secretariat, and it would be possible to see from it the interest taken by the different States in the various activities of the League. At first, at any rate, he would wish to confine the attempt within narrow limits. He thought that the different Sections could prepare a report shewing the Circular Letters sent out, with a short summary of their contents and a short summary of the replies received. He suggested that these should be sent to the Information Section who would co-ordinate the reports.
A discussion followed, in which several members
took part. The majority wore in favour of the principle of
the proposal, and different suggestions were put forward as
to the best machinery for its execution. It was finally
decided to form a small committee, consisting of
M. lufour-Féronce, as Chairman,
M. Contort,
Mr. Loveday,
Mile. Colin,
M. von Schmieden,
M. Valéry-Radot,
to make a report on the best method of putting the proposal into practice on the lines indicated by the Secretary-General. It was thought that the synopsis might start as from January 1st, 1929.

1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL welcomed M. Sugimura on his return from the East.
2.	The meeting considered the provisional agenda for
the Fifty-ninth Session of the Council (Directors’ Meeting Paper 4),	Various points were raised, which Major Buxton was
asked to note for the next edition of the Agenda.
3.	The Secretary-General said that the results of the
Naval Conference, whether good or bad, would influence the work of the League,	If they were good, one consequence would be
to facilitate collaboration between the League and the United
State	s of	America.	If the	v yyere	bad, the	chances of
‘ O h!	ess	being made	.L-Q Cii Sell*		would be	gloomy for
s o me	time	to come.				
If the Conference continued for seme time to cons, then even if the results were good, it might be difficult to hold a meeting of the Preparatory Committee before the next session of the Assembly, It would take some time for the proceedings of the Conference to be made available to the various States concerned, and time would also be required for their examination. While we were all anxious that the Committee should meet as early as possible, if the above developments occurred it vouM be difficult for a meeting to be held before the middle of July, This was an unsuitable time for a meeting: and, in such a case, M. Colban and he thought the meeting might have to be postponed till November.	The important thing to him seemed to be
that the Committee should not fail through lack of adequate preparation.
M. DUrOUE-FShOiTCS said that a number of States would think it regrettable if the meeting were not held before the session of the Assembly.
The ShCHETAHY-GEITlPiAL said that the date of the meeting would, of course, depend on the general opinion of Governments, and of the Chairman.	But it should be
remembered that'the results of the Conference would be of special interest to all naval countries, not only to those at present regarded as leading naval Powers. Due preparation was essential,
IN. Db^OUR-FERONCE still felt that a number of countries would not agree that it was impossible to hold the
u
meeting before the session of the Assembly, In any case, the initiative for holding the meeting until later should not, in his opinion, come from the Secretariat.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the opinion of the Secretariat should be that the meeting should be held as soon as practicable„
M. DTJEOUR-ESRONCE thought that the words "and before the next session of the Assembly” should be included in this definition of the Secretariat’s opinion.
The SECRETARY-GEN TRAL said that he did not agree to the proviso.	Naturally if it were practicable to hold
it before, so much the better.,
4.	M. de HALLER said that the report of the
Parliamentary Commission on events in Palestine had been laid before Parliament on Monday, and that a full resume had appeared in the "Times” of Tuesday.
5	M. ROMS IN said that at the recent session of the
Transit Committee the questions referred to the Committee by the Council in regard to relations between Poland and Lithuania had been considered. However, the report from the Subcommittee which had dealt with the subject had been criticised by both parties. It was hoped that a final report would be prepared in time to submit to the Council at its September session.
6.	Mr. DUNCAN HALL said that the Commission of Enquiry
into opium smoking in the Ear East should be back in Geneva by the end of Aoril. In these circumstances, the report could
hardly be ready in time for the May session of the Councils Prom letters received by the Opium Section, it appeared that the enquiry had given useful results,
Ma SUGIMURA, having thanked the Secretary-General for his words of welcome, summarised his impressions of his stay in Japan. The League was not a new idea in Japan, and at various meetings he had addressed he had noticed an intelligent interest in the League's work* especially in the economic, legal, social and political domains.	Thanks to
the efforts made by the .Japanese Society for the League of Nations and by statesmen like Viscount Ishii, who knew the work of the League at first hand, knowledge of the League was taking root in the country.
Nevertheless, so long as the United States of America and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics were outside the League , Japanese opinion hardly recognised the League as having a universal character. In his lectures he had explained that the League’s collaboration with non-Members increased year by year, so that in many respects it was de facto universal.
This increase of collaboration with non-Members, especially with the United States of America, was of great importance in commending the League to Japan.
The visit to -Japan of League officials, MM. Aveuol, Bonnet, Rajchman, and Cummings, had been most useful. He hoped that advantage would be taken of any suitable opportunity for other members of the Secretariat to visit Japan,

1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he could add nothing of importance to what had been said at the last meeting regarding the date of the next meeting of the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament. In London, Mr. Colban has taken the line that the commission should meet at the earliest possible moment, but -when that would be would depend on the results, still uncertain, of the Naval Conference.
2.	The SECRET ARY-GENERAL, referring to a letter from M. Buero, which had been circulated, stating that there were good hopes of agreement on the questions of nationality and responsibility of States at the Codification Conference, said
that he had heard from M. Buero that the prospects as to the latter were now less good. On the question of responsibility of States, the Conference seemed to be divided into two groups, one consisting roughly of what are known as the Great Powers, and the other of various other Powers, both European and especially Latin American.
It seemed, therefore, that on this subject,, as also on that of territorial waters, there might be no Convention.
3.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL asked Directors to be present in Geneva for the first week in May as the Supervisory Commission was to meet on May 1st.

Mr. COLEAN said that the report which had been drawn up by the Secretariat for the Committee of Five sec forth the reasons which favoured the Batiment Electoral and the Salle de la Reformation, respectively. He thought it would be a mistake to go beyond this and ;ive the impression that the Secretariat favoured the Batiment electoral.
The SBCRFTaRY-GEFYRAL said that if he were asked for
a personal	opinion he would give	it	in favour of the	Batiment
electoral,	but he agreed that the	Se	cretariat should	not
volunteer	any preference, and so	far	as he understood	, the
Secretariat's revert which had been distributed to the Committee was neutral and objective.
Mr. COBBAN said that he was satisfied with this position, though if he were asked his own opinion, it was in favour of the oalle de la Reformation.
The SECRETARY-(MINERAL said that as the Session was
to begin on a ..ednesday, it would probably be necessary to
move the General Committee to ash the Assembly to postpone the

The S'lC3G!TARY-G-'iiINlRML asked that Rapporteurs1 reports for the forthcoming Session of the Council should he prepared as soon as possible.
The 3HCE3TAEY-SEFSRAL, referring to over crowding in the Secretariat, said that he was prepared to ask the Supervisory Commission to agree to the insertion in the 1931 budget for an amount sufficient to provide for the renting of 50 or 60 additional rooms, though the rooms would not be available before the end of the year.

Sir Arthur SALTER said that the prospect of moving further away from the Secretariat made the position more difficult for him. Kis Section had two special reasons for requiring to work near the main building:
1) that its members consulted the Library perhaps more than other lections, 2) that his Section served many more committees and sub-committees in the course of the year than any other Section and for these meetings it was necessary for the staff to be near the main building.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that if the rooms were in the —nnex the extra distance from the main building would be inconsiderable.
Dr. BAJCEMAN said that his Section had already been moved three times and was loth to move again. Also, so many of its members spent a long time away from Geneva that they liked to feel at home when they came back.
In reply to Mr. COLBAN, the Secretary-General said that he was unwilling to require members of -Sections to work two in a room if this c aid. rossibly be avoided.
Dame Rachel CROBDY said that members of her Section were working 2 or oven 3 in a room. She wondered whether certain more or loss independent workers who had rooms in the oection&l quarters plight not be moved on so that the Sections could occupy those rooms.
Sir Art!our SALTER said that his Section was, for accommodation purposes, living on leave, sickness and missions. Other sections might be able to make more room for themselves also by taking; advantage of rooms thus vacated through absence.

As regards the interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant, the negotiations which had taken place had been private and had concerned the British and French Governments only. There was no reference to them in the documents of the Conference, and the Conference itself was not committed by them.
He thought that the results of the Conference were such as to justify the Preparatory Committee in meeting again and terminating its second reading. It was a question of general convenience whether the meeting should be held in the summer or after the Assembly. The President of the Commission was to come to Geneva in a few days in order to

lt	The meeting considered the
agenda of the Pifty-ninth Session of Meeting, Paper 6). Various points Mr. Buxton was asked to note for the
Sir Arthur SALTE3 said that M. Loucheur had sent a letter to the Financial Committee asking it to appoint three members of the Commission tc deal with the Agricultural Fund set up by the EasternReparat ions Agreement recently concluded in Paris, He thought that the Committee should first bo seized by the Counoil, which might ask it to report on the co na it ions oi the a pp o intme nt.
order of items on the the Council (Directors’ were raised which next issue of the agenda.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL doubted whether the Council
should be moved to take any action until the Agreement had bean ratified, Secondly, he did not think it wise to make any conditions, as the duties of the League would end with tho appointment of tho officials who would not be responsible to the League in any way. No risk should be taken of upsetting an agreement arrived at with great difficulty.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that, as the question was most urgent, the Council might agree to make appointments which would take effect so soon as the Agreement came into force.
The Score tary-Ge neral: s second objection raised a wide question of principle'.	Though in theory the League was not
responsible for commissioners which it merely appointed in accordance with international agreements, it was, in fact, blamed if the men appointed proved not to be suitable,
The League had had experience of the inconvenience resulting from this, He did not wish to express a definite opinion on the present case without further examination,
The Deputy SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the Financial Committee should first reply that it was net competent to deal with the matter itself but would refer it to the Council,	The Council should be informed that, as
was the fact, the agreement of three Governments, the British, French and Italian, was necessary for action to be taken.
That agreement might be given by formal declarations before the Council.
It was finally agreed that the Council should, at the request of the Financial Committee, put the question on its agenda anc then ask the Financial Committee to report^ on it. It was hoped that the three Governments concerned would
3 -
be in a position to express their formal agreement at the first stage, i„e. at the Council Meeting»
Be	The SECRETARY-GEHERAL said that the Committee of
Five for Assembly arrangements had recommended that the Assembly should meet in the Batiment Electoral, beginning with this year» It was realised that whatever decision was taken should apply to this year as, if the Assembly met again in the Salle de la Reformation, money would in any case have to be spent on its improvement»	This would ba
wasted if it were decided to meet in the Batiment Electoral next year»
The additional expense involved, which would be caused by the change, would this year amount to 80,000 francs. In future years, it would, if ha remembered rightly, be about BO,000 franos. The Committee was not able to authorise this expenditure but it had informed him of its recommendation in order that he might take such action as ho might find possible. After consulting the Supervisory Commission, he proposed to ask the Council to allocate the funds from the chapter on the Council Unforeseen Expenditure,
The Committee made various oti:er recommendations in connection with the Assembly, of which the most important was that the President should be chosen for his personal capacities and not as representative of this or that nation.
3.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the Supervisory
Commission had not made any great changes in the draft Budget. It had returned to the former estimate used for the Disarmament Conference, namely 300,000 francs, it being understood that this was a merely conventional estimate as', if the Conference was held, it might cost very much more.
4 «
It had inserted in the budget the sua of 760,000 francs lor capital expenditure on the wireless station, this sum being about equal to the surplus available on last .year's budget,
Pinally , it agreed to the renting of 60 additional rooms for the accommodation of the Secretariat, These should mostly be available at the beginning of 1931, though about 8 might be used in July 1930, In return for this decision, the Commission had required the Secretary-General to premise that he would ask for no further accommodation while the Secretariat was in temporary quarters.
The result of these decisions was that the budget now passed the 30,000,000 mark.
Mr. JACSIIK said that, though the budget would no doubt emceed 30,000,000 when the recommendations of the Committee of Thirteen were taken into account, at present it was, apart from the wireless capital expenditure, still used e r th at f ig urc »
The SECRETARY-GEIIIP.AL agreed, adding that the Supervisory Commission had noted with approval the prospects of the budget of the Economic Section being stable for a certain period. It had hopes, not yet fulfilled, that the budgets of all the other technical organisations would also soon be stabilised,
M, AGHIIIDES said that the Committee on Arbitration and Security was expected to end its session on May 9th,
Mr. COLEAIi said that M. Loudon had seen the chief delegates on the Preparatory Committee, who also sat on the Arbitration and Security Committee, and had concluded that it was impracticable to convoke the former Committee
- 5
during the summe r. He had decided to convoke it for th a 3 rd 11 ov enibo r „
60	The SBCRETARY-GHITTRAL said that it was possible
that the Committee of Thirteen on the reorganisation of the Secretariat might meet a few days earlier than June 16th, the date for which the session was now fixed,

H. DUFOUE FEBOIfOE thought that the new L> was the most suitable place for an exhibit of this he hoped that it would be built as soon as possibL
hi iiorar
built
The SEC EE T AB Y - GE IE R A L agreed, hut said that for reasons of economy it would he necessary to erect all the new League buildings more or less simultaneously.
M. IMS said that though interesting exhibits had already been prepared by various sections they had been prepared for international exhibitions and other special purposes. If a permanent exhibit was to be made it would have to be created anew, as the mere coll vet ion of what already existed would not give a general idea of the League's work.
M. COMERT thought that as the material was already abundant all that was needed in order to preserve the right proportions was a judicious choice.
Sir Arthur SAlTEB said that he had intended to
recommend	at	the forthcoming meeting o	1 the Pc	d .ration of
League of	Ha	tions Societies that they	should l	undertake the
task of ma		ng graphic representations	0 i t he	work of the
League. He thought that a body of this kind was more suitabl than the Secretariat to do this work.
Mr. HciCLINOH WOOD thought that much of the most important work of the League, lor instance its political worn, would be difficult to represent graphically. Moreover, he doubted whether the psychological effect of a visit to
the present seat	of	the Le	ague evas so io	T t Uu <3"t n 3,3	to justify
any action being	t ak	:en to	encourage visitors. If		the

office where serious international work was done.
Tue SB CI .A T. il.'. ~ Cr. 1 .Nr B ...L was not impressed by the argument that it was necessary to maintain accurate proportions in the exhibit* He die not think that people who happened to see in one room an interesting representation of, for instance, the health work ol the league, would conclude that the League dealt only with health, especially if there were other exhibits in other rooms. On the whole he thought that the proposal was useful, ana asked M. Dufour feronoe, A. Comert and. Sir Arthur Salter with Hr. Jacklin to consult regarding the best means of giving effect to it. Sir ArthurTs proposal that advantage should be taken of the meeting of the Federation of League oi Nation1 s Societies should also be borne in miikm
2.	The meeting considered the proposals put forward
by Mr. Buxton regarding the records of committee meetings. (Directors' Meeting Paper 7, 1930).
The SSCRSTABY-0EN3RAL thought it would be difficult to make any hard and fast rule-, but that the system best suited to the needs oi each meeting should be adopted, whether it be that of verbatim records, or minutes, or a short summary.
Sir Arthur 3ALTER felt that the distinction lay not between meetings oi Govt rnment representatives and of experts, as suggested by Mr. Buxton, but according to subject. In cases where- it was less important to record the views put forward by the speakers than to record the decisions arrived at, and who re also the discussions were of a kind which precis writers could reproduce accurately, minutes of the meetings should suffice.
4
On the other hand, if it was necessary to record the points of view of the various speakers, and if the subject matter was so technical that precis writers could not be expected to give an accurate account, it seemed necessary to take a verbatim record, which could, of course be summarised afterwards,
Mr. BUXl'Ol drew attention to the tendency to increase the number of verbatim records with the result that the roneo d ep ar t me n "t w s. s being seriously overworked.
M. COMER! said that it was a great help for the press if verbatim records could be taken. This was especially the case whore several meetings wer- being held at once, so that a journalist who was attending one meeting could quickly get an accurate report of another.
Mr. MGZIN10H FOOD said that the taking of minutes by precis writers necessarily involved a greater delay in the issue of the record than the system of verbatim records. He wondered why the plenary meetings of the Assembly were reported verbatim, while only minutes were taken of the Assembly committees, the debates of 'which were often more important than the plenary meetings. In any case it seemed impossible to avoid roneoing minutes twice, as it was essential to allow members to correct the provisional minutes.
M. DUFOUR FEHGICE said that his Section had got over this difficulty by not issuing the final minutes of sub-committees. When the corrections of members to the provisional minutes wore received, a final copy was typed and kept in the Secretariat, The minutes of the plenary committee , on the other hand, were printed. In both cases it was nossible to avoid the second roneoing. As far as his work was concerned ho was satisfied with the system of minutes, and did not desire a verbatim record.
M. SUGIMURA said that he had "been highly satisfied with the minutes of the Oommittee on Arbitration and Security.
The SEORBihiHY-GBKERAL said that it was out of the question for budgetary reasons to provide verbatim records of ail League meetings. The general rule should be that minutes should be taken, and that verbatim records should be authorised only in cases where minutes would be unsuitable.
M. COijERT said that he had beard that for the meetings of the Pan-American Union modernised dictaphones were now being used with satifactory results. Perhaps am enquiry into this system might be made.
Sir Arthur SALTER thought that while dictaphones might la satisfactory for formal subjects, they would not give a satisfactory record in the ordinary round-table League discussions, consisting, as they largely did, of whisperings in languages but imperfectly understood by the speakers.
Mr. JACKLIE said his experience shewed that the use of dictaphones aid not lead to reduction of staff.
M. HAAS thought that at any rate a case had been made for studying the system for the Assembly.
It was agreed to ask Mr. Huston who could get into touoi with the Pan-American Union, and who knew the requirements of the League in this matter, to make a report.

L.	The 3ECRETAR Y-G1LERAL, referring to the recent session
of the Council, said that in his opinion the reason for its short
6
duration was that most- of the..items on the agenda were technical and had been well prepared> so that little discussion was requiredo As the Assembly was to meet at its next session on a Wednesday, the Council had in principle agreed to meet on the Friday before* On the other hand, if the agends were small the meeting would he postponed till the Monday. They should not be convoked for the earlier date if there was any risk of their not having enough to do»
As the Assembly was to meet on a Wednesday he thought that the General Committee should recommend that rules drawn up on the assumption that the Assembly began on a Monday, for instance the rule requiring elections to the Council to be held on the second Monday, should this year be modified* It seemed desirable that the elections to the Council should be held on the second Wednesday and that the debate on the work of the League should finish on the Tuesday.
6.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the League had
received officially, for information, M, BriandTs Memorandum on a European union. He did not propose to open a discussion on this q\iestion at present*
The proposals were still in provisional form and as the matters dealt with were most delicate, and as Governments were being consulted, he thought that members of the Secretariat should refrain from expressing any official opinion on them.

Il ajoute "''Seulement que la Fédération des Associations pour la Société des liât ions tiendra prochainement une réunion à Genève. Il prie donc les Membres du Secrétariat de fournir aux délégués participant à cette réunion tous renseignements et toute aide dont ils pourraient evoir besoin.
M. COMERT annonce qu’un éminent sculpteur genevois doit faire prochainement don au Secrétariat d’un buste du Dr. Nansen.
M. JOHNSON demande au Secrétaire général s’il peut donner des renseignements au sujet d’un nouvel appel à adresser aux organisations de bienfaisance en faveur des réfugiés.
LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL répond qu’il vient de recevoir une lettre privée de Lord. Cecil, suggérant que certaines personnalités éminentes pourraient lancer un nouvel appel pour la constitution d'un fonds à la mémoire du Dr. Nansen, afin de permettre l'achèvement de l’oeuvre d’établissement des réfugiés. Le Secrétaire général a répondu à Lord Cecil qu’il ne peut qu’approuver sa suggestion, On voit donc qu’il s'agit non point d'un appel de la Société des Nations, mais d’un appel de certaines personnalités qui jouissent d’une grande autorité dans la vie internationale,
M. JOHNSON demande à la Section d’information de donner à l’appel, s’il est lancé, toute la publicité nécessaire.
M. LUKAC annonce que le Comité permanent juridique de la Commission consultative des Communications et du Transit se réunira à Paris le 10 juin et que la Section administrative du Comité permanent des transports par voie ferrée de la Commission consultative des communications et du transit tiendra également une réunion à Paris le 11 juin.

of League of Nations Associations, perhaps because it had been held in Geneva, had refrained from passing resolutions of an embarrassing or extreme kind. This made it easier for the Secretariat to help the Associations, as it always desired to do.

was	tha	t Finland		felt	her isol
on	the	support	of	the	League.
In particular, it attached the highest importance to the question of financial assistance.
He had spoken at the University on the ten years’ work of the League to an audience which had struck him as particularly representative and well informed. He felt that all should he done to increase Finland’s confidence in the League.
The »Secretary-General having observed that M. Procope had particularly welcomed the Marquis Paulucoi as coming from a southern country, the point of view of which was less understood in Finland than that of the northern countries, the Marquis Pauluoci said that he had been able to show that the interest that Italy took in the League was greater than had been supposed.
M. COLEAN wished to draw attention to the Office Circular which had been issued, requesting directors to introduce to the high officials of the »Secretariat new members of their Sections. He himself attached considerable importance to this practice bocauso ho felt that with the growth in numbers of the Secretariat there was the danger of the different Sections drifting away from each other and not collaborating as they might, He thought the time might come- when it would be necessary to organise in some way collaboration between the Sections. Moreover, he wondered whether the position of the Directors’ Meeting might not be- reviewed.	He felt, and he had put forward similar
views some years ago, that more use should be made of the meeting as a moans for the frank expression of views between members. In order that this might be possible, it might be
3
necessary to restrict attendance at the meeting to titular members only. The Committee of Thirteen would shortly have to consider the problem of ensuring that the various nationalities should have their proper influence in the Secretariat. Though no perfect solution of this problem could ever be found, he thought it would help if all directors felt that at the Directors' Meeting they could give their views on important questions affecting the Secretariat as a whole and thus take a real part in the political direction of the Secretariat.
The SDCRjjTARY-GSIflRAL said that the problem was very difficult. The Directors’ Meeting had been instituted in order to give Directors an opportunity of exchanging views and of knowing what was happening in the Secretariat as a whole.
The influence that a .given director could exert on policy depended on his personal qualifications. M. Colban, for instanc had had qualifications which had enabled him to exert a very great influence.
The difficulty in the way of allowing all subjects affecting the League to be freely discussed at the meeting was that, as experience has shown, it v.as impossible to count on the proceedings of any meeting held in Geneva being kept secret and if it was reported that certain views had been expressed at a Directors’ Meeting on some delicate political problem it would be said that such and such was the view of the Secretariat.
It was for this reason that he had thought it wise to ask the meeting not to discuss the Briand Memorandum, at any rate before Governments had replied.
M. COMERT feared that if political discussions took place at the meeting,
each member would inevitably find himself
f
4 r
defending the point of view of his own country. This might tend to destroy the friendly collaboration which sections wore able to practise so long as they kept strictly to their own work.
bir Arthur SALTER thought that, in spite of what M. Content had said, it was useful for directors to know and appreciate other points of view than their own, and that a pooling of their ideas would be useful to the work of all, Personally he regretted that there had been no discussion of the Briand Memorandum. It might help if, for the discussion of questions of this kind as apart from questions upon which the meeting was called upon to formulate a definite opinion, no minutes were taken.
The SECBETARY-GEEERAL said that he would consider sympathetically any proposals made and asked M. Cobban to put his views on paper.
6.	M. AZCARATS said that Greece and Turkey had signed an agreement instituting the procedure to be followed for the settlement of outstanding questions regarding the liquidation of property.
7.	M, ASCABATE said that the Polish Government had informed the Secretariat that it had decided to accept
iVj-. Calender's opinion regai’ding the petition of certain doctors of the Spolka Bracka. In view of this infonaation it seemed unnecessary to hold the meeting of a committee of jurists on this question, which the Council decided upon at its last session, and the Rapporteur would therefore make new proposals to the Council in view of the changed
situation
Lame Rachel CV.OLDY said that next month she was to leave Geneva in order to represent the Secretariat at the
Pan-Pacific "omenTs Conference at Honolulu of the Conference wore questions relating health, industry, social problems and the
. On the agenda to education, nationality of
married women. If directors wished to brief her on any points which concerned the work of their Lections, she would he happy to receive their views.
M. SUGIHIP.ii said that Prince Takamatsu, brother of the Emperor of Japan, had been genuinely impressed by his visit to the Secretariat on the preceding day. The' visit had been without ceremony, as the Prince had been anxious to see things as they were. He would no doubt inform the Emperor of his impressions and in view of the unique influence exercised by the Imperial Family, he felt it a great gain that the Cniperor should have this means of receiving news of Geneva.
The SECRETARY-GHITERAL said that he had been most happy to receive the Prince and was grateful to M. Sugimura for having arranged the visit, though he felt very much on occasions of this kind the want of anything striking to show visitors in the Secretariat building.

The ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL said that from information supplied to him by Mr0 Bant on, it appeared to be quite impossible to hold all the meetings arranged for the last three months of the year at the dates which had been fixeac Some re-arrangement was necessary, as the resources of the Central Services, especially of the Roneo Service, were insufficient to meet the needs of all the meetings;,
In the course of the discussion, the following statements were made and decisions taken■;«-
Mo BUERO stated that it was almost certain there would be no Codification Conference in 1S30„
In view of the number of meetings in November, it was agreed to ask the Mandates Commission to put their meeting forward and finish by November 3rd.
It was agreed that if, as seemed probable, the meeting of the Advisor;?- Committee on Traffic in Opium could not be hold in August, it should be held in the first week of December and not in November,
The Consultation of Experts on Prices should be held if possible in August, not at the beginning of October.
It was agreed to ask the Economic Committee to endeavour to finish before November 3rd, or in any event to reduce to a minimum its demands on staff after that date.
M0 HAAS said that the Transit Legal Committee on September 10th and the European Commission of the Danube on October 27th required no staff from the central services,
Mr, FELKIN said that the Gold Committee meeting on November 4th could not be postponed but that the meeting on Prohibitions (November 3rd) was in eny case doubtful, and might perhaps be postponed? It might be essential, however,to hold it before the Tariffs Conference beginning on November 15th, which in any case could not be postponed, He agreed that the meeting of Experts on the Statistical Convention could probably be postponed.	It was intended to hold the meeting between
the middle of November and December 1st. Also the Conference on Central Police Offices which was to be held at the end of November or the beginning of December could almost certainly be postponed, and the Economic Consultative Committee, the date of which was in any event doubtful might possibly be postponed until 1931.
M. HAAS said that as regards the Conference for the Unification of River Law temporary precis-writers might be required but he hoped to do without interpsrbers as French alone would probably be used.
Mr. F3LKIN said it would be impossible to postpone the meeting on Customs Nomenclature.
It was agreed to endeavour to fix so far as possible during the Assembly the dates of meetings during the following 12 months, and to produce a provisional Calendar for those 12 months showing the dates were oocupied and what were free.

60th Session of the Council.
The SECRET ART-GEEEAL said that the last Council had decided to hold its pre-Assembly meeting either on the 5th or on the 8th September, according to the work to be done. He suggested that they should examine the Agenda ana see if there '.mas enough work for two meetings on Friday, two on Saturday and two on Monday.
After reviewing the <pestions on the Agenda, it was decided that the Council need not be summoned till Monday September 8th, at 11 o'clock.
Mr. Buxton vjas instructed to make certain changes in the order of the Agenda.
Eleventh Session of the Assembly.
The SECRET ART-GEERAL s into force the recommendations of
id it was impossible to put the small Committee on Procedure
-2-
this year* The practice of previous years would therefore have to he followed, i.e„ Wednesday and Thursday morning would be taken up by procedure and the general discussion would begin on Thursday afternoon. He thought that the elections to the Council should be held on the following Wednesday, the general discussion finishing on Tuesday evening. M. de Montenach and Mr. Wilson would, as usual, draw up a prograrne of business.
M. AYEI-IOl said that M. de Montenach had a proposal which would gain half a day, namely, appointing the Credentials Committee before the President’s speech,
It was agreed to adjourn the discussion of Assembly arrangements until the next Directors* Meeting, when M. de Montenach’s proposal would be before them.
Communication from the Cuban Government regarding the Court Protocol.
The SECRET ARY-GENERAL reported that the Cuban Government had formally refused to ratify the amended Protocol. The election of Judges would therefore have to be according to the old Statute, as there was no hope that the new Statute could now go through.
Naval Conferenoe.
M. AGHNIDES stated that the United States had ratified the London Naval Treaty signed on April 22nd, 1930. Opium:	Conference on Limitation of Manufacture.
Mr. DUNCAN HALL said governments had been very slow in replying to the C.L. concerning this Conference. Only two or three had as yet sent any communication on the subject.

Duncan Hall
Jacklin Johnson McKinnon Wood de Montenach Pietromarchi von Schmieden Yigier Wilson.
1.	The meeting considered the note on the organisation of the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly (Dii-ectors’ neeting paper 11), Various observations were made which M. de Montenach was asked to note.
The following points also arose in the course of the discussion:
It was agreed that the choice between the two alternative programmes for the opening meetings be left over until immediately before the Assembly, as the decision would depend on the question of the speakers for the general debate on Thursday Horning. The rest of the note could be issued so soon as convenient.
It was agreed uhat if the second alternative were following the meetings of committees should not be held simultaneously but successively, at intervals of twenty minutes, for the purposes of electing their presidents and vice-presidents only.
Item 26 of the Assembl?y agenda: ( International reciprocity in the care of the sick). It was agreed that the
j
2
Health and Social Sections should discuss whether this question could he more suitably referred to the Second or to the Fifth Committees and that M, de Montanach should be informed of the result *
Item 4 (Report of the Committee of Five on Assembly Arrangements), and t
Item 5 (Increase in the number of vice-presidents of the
Assembly).
After discussion it was agreed that it should be left to the General Committee to propose to the Assembly the procedure to be followed in regard to these items.
Item 5 (Election of non-permanent Members of the Council):
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the General Committee should propose that these elections should be held on the 17th.
Item 24 (Election of members of the Permanent Court) and:
Item 7 (Election of members of the Supervisory Commission^
The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the General Committee should propose that these elections be held towards the end of the session,
In reply to Mr, JOHNSON, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he thought that the report of the Advisory Commission to the High Commissioner of Refugees should, as there was at present no High Commissioners be forwarded to him for submission to the Council» The Council would then doubtless transmit it to the Assembly,
5
Tlie SECRETARY-CtSHEHAL hoped that this year it would bo possible for the members of the Secretariat to refrain from answering questions as to who ware likely to be appointed
to the various offices of the Assembly, as the Secretariat ha
u
been criticised in the past because of its alleged Interference in the conduct of the Assembly.
2o Mr, Duncan HALL said that certain information which lead reached the Secretariat regarding a very large consignment of illicit drugs from Turkey had- thanks to the action which it had been possible to take? led to the seizure of the drugs at a European port.
3. Mr. JOHNSON said that the work of his Section would be seriously inconvenienced during the Assembly owing to the insistence of the Swiss Authorities that a member of his staff should be absent on military service during part of the session, and asked whether anything further could be done.
M, de MOHTENACH said that it was absolutely impossible to approach Berne again on the subject. Every possible persuasion had been used with the Swiss Authorities both as regards the case to which Inc. Johnson referred and other similar cases. The Swiss Authorities had acceded t© the wishes of the Secretariat in the majority of such cases^ but insisted that a certain number should perform military service at the time indicated.
Sir Arthur SALTER did not wish to attach importance to the particular case referred to by Mr. Johnson as it concerned a temporary and not a permanent member of the Secretariat, but he thought that the general question whether a permanent member could be recalled by his Government for military service required study,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that the difficulty was
that most of the delegations to the Assembly appeared to sympathise with the view of the Swiss Authorities that Swiss members of the Secretariat should be recalled for this purpose. It should be recognised that the position of Swiss officials was exceptional in this respect.
Sir Arthur SALTER said that if it was a question of the Swiss officials only the matter was not so serious, but did the question rest there? His own view was that a permanent member of the Secretariat was not at the orders of his Government for any purpose whatsoever.
M„ HAAS wondered whether means might not be found for declaring that permanent members of the Secretariat were not mobilisable.
Mr. McKinnon WOOD thought that the higher staff was already protected by its diplomatic privileges and immunities,
The SECRETARY-GENERAL felt that a discussion of such a difficult subject, except after careful reflection, should be avoided. He asked the Legal Section to prepare a memorandum on the question for his information.
4. M, AZCARATE said that M. Calonder had resigned from his position as President of the Upper Silesian Mixed Commission. The Council would doubtless consider in due course the question of the appointment of a successor.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL took the opportunity to deny emphatically from information he had received from M. Calonder • that the resignation was due to political reasons, It was due entirely to reasons of personal and family convenience.

5.	M. AGHNTDE3 raised the question whether it was wise for a Committee af the Assembly charged with the consideration of a given item to submit that item for advice to another committee.	He thought it might be better if the considera-
tion of the question remained always with the committee to which it was referred, and to which a delegation could always appoint whichever cf its members was an expert on a particular aspect cf the question which came up for discussion.
After an exchange of views, the SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he agreed that the committee to which a question was referred must remain responsible for its treatment and make the final reports to the Assembly. He would not like, however, to exclude the possibility of the reference of a question for advice to another committee0

1)	The meeting considered the order of items at the 60th Session of the Courcil (Directors’ Meeting Paper No. 12). Various observations were made, which Mr. Buxton was asked to ».ote for the next issue of the Agenda.
2)	The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that one of the results which was expected to follow from the transfer of the Assembly to the Batiment Electoral was that its debates would be conducted with greater dignity than before.
To this	end	he asked i	or	the assistance of Directors in
seeing	that	the member	hi	of the staff avoided unnecessary

lie MARQUIS PAULUCCI said that it would be s year, if an expenditure of about Sr. lr. 3,000 , to make arrangements in the Secretariat listening-in to the Assembly rebates. Probably loud speakers and twenty headphones would be
available.
After some discussion it vas agreed that the experiment should be tried this year and directors were asked to send in suggestions to the marquis Paulucci regarding the arrangements they wish to see made for their ov.n Sections. It was also agreed that the expense should be borne partly by the budget of the Transit Section and partly by "Secretariat Unforeseen".
4)	THE SEC RET ARY - GENERAL said that if it were decided to conclude all the formalities ox the opening of the Assembly Session on the first day he would propose that the Assembly should again meet on the Thursday morning at 11 o’clock so as to permit, if desirable, a meeting of
the General Committee being held before.
The Secretary-General agreed with the suggestion of Mr. Bieler that the Committees at their first meeting might confine themselves to the election cf their presidents, leaving over to their next meetings, to be held after the conclusion of the general debate, the election of their vice-presidents and the examination of their agenda.

1.	The SECRETARY-GENERAL thought that the discussions
which had tahen place in the Assembly on the harmonisation of the Covenant and the Kellogg Pact tended to show that the value of such an attempt was at the least doubtful.
Its main object was, as had been said, "to put teeth into the Kellogg Pact." There were very grave differences of opinion as to whether this was wise.

In reply to said that the failure disappointment in some would give a handle to
the Secretary-General, Mr. SUEETSSR would probably excite surprise and quarters in the United States and certain facile criticisms of the
League. On the whole, however, the country was so much preoccupied with the economic situation that he did not
think that these criticisms would go very far.
M. ATE1TQL thought that the result was to weaken both the Covenant and the Pact. It showed very clearly that great caution was necessary in any attempt to revise such a delicately balanced instrument as the Covenant.
M. SUGIMURA said that the Covenant and the Pact differed from each other not only in the obligations they imposed, but in the fundamental political conceptions from which they arose. It was easier to coordinate the texts than to coordinate these varying conceptions.
Sir Arthur SALTER wished to qualify the statement made by the Secretary-General to this extent, that while the effect of the proposed amendments would be to strengthen the additional obligations assumed by the Members of the League, the obligations of tha non-Members who were parties to the Kellogg Pact would not, in his opinion, be affected thereby. He had always felt that it would have been better to proceed not by way of amendment but by way of an Assembly resolution.
26	The SECRET ARY - GEHERAL felt that the decision
the Assembly to give effect to the demands of the staff
of
in
i
— ^

regard to permanency and pensions was remarkable, especially when the present economic crisis was considered. As regards the important questions which had been 3a ft over, that of the higher direction of the Secretariat, tie report of the competent Committee would have to be awaited. The consideration of certain other questions e.g.
Sabbatical leave, were postponed till nest year.
He also attached importance to the decision which had been taken authorising the Secretary-General to appoint experts as temporary meiabers of the Secretariat for short periods for particular pieces of work. 4
3.	deferring to the decision, that the Assembly
would always meet	on a Monday,	the	SEC	RETARY-	GENERAL hoped
that it would be possible to a		vo id	giv	ing the	impression
that the Assembly	was expected	10		within	three weeks.
4.	Sir Arthur S.ALTER said that he had been wholly-
satisfied with the loud speakers installed in the Secretariat during the Assembly debates, He asked that in future a loud speaker should also be installed in one of the rooms at the Bâtiment Electoral, as this would be of assistance to members of the Secretariat who had to meet delegates at the Assembly, and who wished to hear as much of the speeches as possible.
The SECT
LRY-GEEERAL said that he
mid a
internal administration to see to this.
5,
Second
Sir Arthur Committee had
SALTER thought been more close
that the debates of tire ly knit and more real
than ever before.
should be remembered, however,
I
that
4
a period of depression such as the present was not suitable for the advance of that liberal economic policy with which the League had hitherto been associated.
Such a crisis inevitably forced States into a defensive attitude and a search for arrangements calculated to yield immediate benefits.
He foresaw that in the near future the question of the most-favoured-nation clause would be of very special importance in the League’s economic ?vork. It might be necessary to admit certain exceptions to this clause and in any case the League organs, if they were to remain in touch with the realities of the situation, could not afford to maintain a doctrinaire attitude in the question.
6.	Sir Arthur SALTER said that in view of the
Assembly’s approval of the report of the Financial Committee, it was now the case that the Financial Committee would be prepared to give advice to Members of the League without taking any responsibility in regard to the acceptance of such advice.	This would tend to remove the fear felt
by some States that a request for advice might involve League interference in financial policy.
7.	Dr. RUCHMM wondered whether the time had not
come when the debates of the Second Committee should be arranged to some extent before the session of the Assembly. For instance, certain subjects might be selected and discussed with certain Governments who could bring prepared memoranda to the Committee. In this way discussionswould be better prepared and more concentrated. On the other hand, he was opposed to the view that the debates of the Second Committee should be of a technical character.

10.	Mr. ABRAHAM said that the Sixth Committee had
devoted three full days to the question of minorities. There had "been disagreement on three main points: (1} The
right of	the	Assembi	■y	to discuss the	manner	in which the
Council g	;ave	effect	to	its guarantee	of the	mino rities
treaties	(th	e right	of	the Assembly	to deal	with the
question in general terms under Article 3 of the Covenant was, of course, not contested). (2) The question whether the assent of the States bound by minorities treaties was required before any changes of the procedure instituted by the Council could be made. (3) The question of the extension of obligations towards minorities to States other than those already bound by the treaties.
The debate had been resumed in a very skilful report presented by M. Motte to the Assembly.
11.	M. Á7BN0L said that the duties which the
Secretariat had assumed in regard to refugees, namely, their legal protection, though important, was not expected to impose a large amount, of additional work on the staff.
As regards the other aspects of the refugees' problem, the international office which was to be set up would be legally independent of the League, though the Assembly, inasmuch as it would be called upon to grant a subvention, would have a certain moral and practical responsibility.

13.	The SECRETARY--GENERAL said that Council elections
had brought strongly into evidence the disadvantages under irhich those States lay who did not form part of what was now

1} The SE CR ST.1R Y - GENERAL said that representations had been made to him by permanent delegates accredited to the League to the effect that when members of the Secretariat proceeded on League business to the countries of the permanent delegates, the latter should be informed.
The Secretary-General thought that this was a reasonable proposal and decided, with tie agreement of the mseting, to issue instructions to that effect«
2) The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he would be leaving for South America on about the 1st of December and expected to return on about the 1st of March.

clarifying the situation.
Sir ARTHUR SALTER thought t;at the present ad hoc arrangement was satisfactory and feared that any attempt to formulate too precisely the methods of collaboration would be difficult at the present stage cf the development of
;he League

ionomic action,
	The DEPUTY S	EC RET ARY-GEIEfRAL sa id	that in any
nothing	would bo done	o t hem ice t ' &. n t hr ough	friendly ag
between	the two bodies	, but at Rome a desire	hod been
expresse	â t ]y 3. t t.h Q t VO	organisations should	study what w
the field of collaboration open to them in view of their respective constitutional status, and by what new methods, if any, this collaboration should b
effected. The Secretary General had already been requested by the Council to put forward proposals on the subject and it had now been decided that each organization should appoint a jurist to examine the legal and constitutional situation.
The Marquis PAULUCCI added that the representation of the League at Rome and the cork which the Deputy Secretary-
n
general
had been able to do, had produced a good impression.
4)
;o the
current
Sir Arthur SALTER, referring t activities of the Economic Organisation, said that a most useful meeting of the Gold Delegation, in which the technical
discussions had reached
emarkedlv hivh level, had in s'
ended. Probably no renort would be issued as a result cf this meeting, but a full report would be issued in May.
On the 17th of November a Conference would meet to consider whether it was possible to bring into force the Commercial Convention concluded earlier in the year, and also to decide upon future negotiations as to international tariff policy.
In the past month members of his Section had gone on mission in connection with various activities of the Organisation
to Athens, Sofia, Warsaw and Belgrade,
In reply to the Secretary-General, Sir Arthur Salter said that while the forthcoming Conference should make progress in certain subsidiary matters, on the main question of international tariff policy there was little reason to be optimistic. In times of general economic degression such as the presait, each country tended to be on the defensive. An atmosphere favourable to the policy for which the League stood could be found only when nations were prosperous and were prepared to take
risks In order to become mere prosperous,
5)	M. CATASTUTI said that the Mandates Commission had various important questions to deal with at its present session, the most important being the question of the conditions under which a mandate could be terminated. In estern Samoa, where there had'been trouble for a considerable time, the position now appeared to he improving.
Bucarest
6)
and
K. AZCABATE said that he had recently visited Belgrade with a view to discussing Minority questions
His mission
■with the competent Government authorities, had been limited to this object and he had therefore not had an opportunity of coming into touch except superficially with the Minorities themselves.	In both capitals he got the
Impression that Minorities questions were treated seriously and formed no small part of the affairs of Government.
The SSCBETIJaT-GINERAL said that the recently appointed Hungarian delegate to the League had spoken with appreciation to him of M. i.zcarate's mission and bed said that in his view a similar mission to Budapest with a similarly defined objective would be welcome.
7)	The SECRETART-GENERAL having commented with great satisfaction upon the conclusion of the Greco-Turkish Agreement, M. AGBNIEES suggested that the Secretary-General might congratulate M. Ven@ze7i.os and indeed both parties, which, had achieved very important results fully in accord with the spirit of the Covenant.
The SECRETARY-GENERAL said that he would write to M. Yenezelos accordingly and would see the first delegate of Turkey to the Preparatory Commission.
8)	M. ACHETEES said that in spite of all the difficulties he had good hopes of a successful issue of the work
of the Preparatory Commission. The atmosphere of the debates had been friendly even in discussing matters on which there was the widest and most fundamental divergence of opinion.
The conciliatory attitude of the United States delegation, especially as regards the question of limitation of material,
was most welcome.

10) The 32DR3T jLSY-G3IE3MI» appealed to Directors when they same to draft their budgets for nest year to do their utmost to
are id asking for any increase. A large increase had b s en voted by the Assembly last year for exceptional reasons, but a number of countries had aoseptod it most reluctantly and had made it plain that if there tea an increase next year they would have to reconsider their position in the League. It was therefore
most important in the larger interests of the League to ex ere is e
the s' rictest eocnomy at present•
Li. CATASTIlfl. referring to the inroads on sectional

Hr. JaCLLII; said that the budget of the Central Services provided only for their normal work. If unforeseen exceptional expenditure occurred it was met so far as possible by the oudgsts
—» o ~i
of the Sections concerned, ot he raise b alternative was for sectional budgets provide for the contingency of expend.i
y transfer. The only to be so increased as to ture which might in fact
not be incurred.
The 3EGHSTAHY-S3HBEAL said that a demand for temporary staff arose because several important meetings were held at the same time. Directors had b$en requested to inform the Under Secretary-General in charge of Internal Administration as early as possible of the dates at which meetings concerning their Sections were expected to be held. If stricter attention were paid to this rule it should be possible to arrange meetings so as to avoid considerable overlapping, This was the only means of preventing excessive expenditure on temporary staff.
The Marquis P.1ULUCGI wondered if it might not be best to provide in the budget of the Central Services for all relevant expenditure, part of which was now included in the budgets of Sections.
The DEPUTY SECURETAHY-GEHERAL thought it was impossible to meet M. Catastini*3 difficulty, as whan the Sections di'ew up their budgets it was impossible to foresee what meetings would be held during the year to which the budget referred,,
M. HAAS thought that a more generous provision for temporary staff should be made in the sectional budgets«
Mr« JACKlIn hold that in budgeting for meetings of Conferences «.r.ri Committees a sufficient margin was allowed at present to meet justifiable* demands for temporary staff. It
- V
should be remembered that inroads were newer made on the budgets of Sections to meet the expenditure of other Sections u nl es s t h ey c o uld a f f e rd if «
The 3E0ESTASr-GBUEML agreed with the Treasurer,
If the Seotions which were ashed to hand over some of their money could not afford it, they would have a grievance, but this was not the oase. He feared that M. Haas1 suggestion must produce the very result which he wanted at all costs to avoid, at any rate while tho present depression lasted, namely of increasing the budgets

I.- Le SECiSDMIDM C3ITERAL rappelle que les travaux ce la Commission préparatoire du Désarmement avancent rapidement et cru'il y a lieu de penser que la Conférence se réunira, soit à la fin de 1121, soit au commencement de 1922. Elle durera peut-être 8 mois, peut-être plus longtemps, si elle décide éventuellement de s'ajourne pour permettre aux Gouvernements de se consulter.
La Conférence apportera aux Services centraux, et eu Secrétariat en général, un énorme surcroît de travail. Il est très désirable que les Sections n'envisagent la convocation, en 1322, d'aucuns autre réunion, sauf les réunions régulières des Commissions Toute autre Conférence qui se réunirait en meme temps que la Conférence du Désarmement obtiendrait, d'ailleurs, très peu de publicité. De plus, il serait difficile aux différents experts gouvernementaux de suivre une autre conférence, étant donné que, uans bien des cas, leurs services seraient requis par la Conférence du Désarmement elle-même. Le Secrétaire général prie donc les Directeurs de tenir compte de ces faits en préparant leurs projets de budget pour 1922.

2. M	Duncan HAIL, signale	que la Conférence	des pay	s qui febri
quent	des stupéfiants s’est	réunie à Londres.	Elle a	obtenu un
succès	partiel, un résultat	définitif n’ayant	pu être	acquis sur
un point important, Le Gouvernement des Soviets et le Gouvernement turo étaient représentés à la conférence.
Le Gouvernement des Soviets a fourni des informations statistiques complètes, ainsi que des renseignements sur sa législation.
En ce qui concerne la Turquie, il 7 a lieu de signaler qu'elle a fourni, l'an dernier, quatorze tonnes d'héroïne et de morphine au trafic illicite«, D'après les informations que donnent les saisies effectuées, la fabrication dans ce pays a atteint,
depuis le mois de juin dernier, des chiffres élevés. Les manufactures établies en Turquie ITont été, en partie, grâce à des capitaux européens et l’on peut estimer qu’un tiers de la récolte turque transformée en stupéfiants sert à alimenter le trafic illicite.
Les représentants de la Turquie, dans des conversations privées, ont indiqué qu’ils étaient prêts à supprimer les trois fabriques existantes, à établir ’an monopole d’Etat avec une seule fabrique et à présenter une nouvelle demande de contingentement*
Il y a lieu de noter qu’actuellement il n’existe aucun contrôle effectif en ce qui concerne la production turque. Si la Turquie continue dans la voie où elle e’est engagée, il y a lieu de croire qu’il en résulterait un boycottage de toute son exportation de produits bruts, qui est, pour elle, plus importante que l’exportation de produits manufacturés.
La Conférence a rédigé un rapport enregistrant un accord sur le mode de distribution et sur le plan général d’un système de contingentement. Il reste maintenant à rédiger un projet de convention. Il y a lieu de roter- à cet égard que les pays de consommation n’étaient pas représentés à Londres.
En ce qui concerne les contingents, aucun accord n’a été réalisé entre les pays de fabrication, mais les négociations reprendront à Paris, dans quelques jours, entre les fabricants. Si l’accord est réalisé avant janvier, on peut envisager que la Conférence réussira, à moins que d'autres plans ne soient proposés.

X. Examen du projet d’ordre du .jour provisoire de 1 a 62èms session du Conseil. (Directors Meeting Paper 14, 1930).
M. AVSNQL ouvre la discussion sur le projet d’ordre
du jour.
Au sujet du point 2 (Rapport de la Commission des Mandats), M. de HALLER signale qu’il pourrait y avoir une discussion sur la question du régime des étrangers en Irak, bien qu’il y ait lieu de croire que la question sera réglée avant la session.
Apres le point 4, M, McKINNON WOQD signale qu'il y aurait lieu d’ajouter une nouvelle question: examen de la liste des ratix ications.
Au sujet du point 11 (nomination de la Commission d'expert statisticiens), M. AVENOL demande à la Section financière d'ôtudie avec _Xa-Section juridique la question de savoir si le Conseil a
formellement approuvé le mode de nomination -(par le Conseil, plus un délégué de chaque Etat non membre de la Société et ayant ratifié la Convention ou y ayant accédé). La question ne se pose actuellement que pour un seul Etat non membre de la Société, à savoir llEgypte.
Au sujet du point 15.b (protection des minorités en Haute Silésie), M. de AZCARATE signale que quelques points pourront peut-être être retirés de l'ordre du jour définitif.
Au sujet du point 19 (Commission préparatoire de la Conférence du désarmement), M. AGHNIDES signale que le Conseil aura à se prononcer sur la date à laquelle la conférence générale sera convoquée; sur la fixation, par un Comité d'experts, de la puissance motrice des aéronefs, ainsi que sur l'établissement de tableaux relatifs aux armements existants.
Quant au point 80 (fabrication privée et publicité de la fabrication des armes), M. AGHNIDES signale que la réunion de la Cçmmission spéciale devra être ajournée après le Conseil de mai ou à une date ultérieure, avant l'Assemblée,
Au sujet du point 32 ((Commission de l'Opium),
Dame R&ùhel CROWDY signale que la question devra être retirée de l'ordre du jour si la Commission, qui se réunit le 9 janvier, n’a pas terminé ses travaux.
M. HAAS signale qu'il sera nécessaire d'ajouter une nouvelle question, à savoir la convocation de la 4ème conférence générale des communications et du transit.
M. AGHNIDES signale qu'il y aura probablement lieu d’ajouter une nouvelle question, à savoir le retrait de la requête britannique au sujet de l'application de la convention de l'935 sur le commerce des armes.
M. AVENOL signale que le Marquis Paulucci di Calboli Barone a fait étudier un certain nombre d'observations présentées -par Lord Cecil, Celui-ci a fait remarquer que, quand les rapports présentés au Conseil étaient longs, leur lecture était souvent suivie avec peu d'attention.
- 3 -
Dans les cas où il est nécessaire de faire de longs rapports, il n’est peut-être pas indispensable de les lire d’un bout à l’autre Seules les résolutions doivent nécessairement être lues et leur lecture pourrait être précédée d’un résumé du rapport préparé à l’usage du rapporteur.
M. McKINNON WOOD signale un précédent: le représentant de l’Italie résume, son rapport sur la cordification. Il suffirait, semble-t-il, que le rapporteur déclarât que si la lecture de son rapport n’est pas demandés, il se bernera à le résumer.
M. de AZGAP.AÏE signale qu’il y aura B Z ou 23 comités
de minorités dont une dizaino étudieront des questions particulièrement importantos„ II souhaite qu'on tienne compte de cette
situation en fixant les heures des séances du Conseil.
II. LA ÀGHNIDES dit que la Commission préparatoire du désarmement a tenu sa dernière réunion, comme l’avait demandé l'Assemblée. Bien que, pour le fond, elle n’ait pu aller plus loin que les textes qu’elle a élaboréss-car il fallait trouver la résultante de toutes les tendances,- il y a lieu de noter que la Commission est revenue sur certains articles déjà lus en deuxième lecture et auxquels elle a apporté des modifications importantes.
Le cadre de la Convention paraît assez élastique pour pouvoir s’adapter aux circonstances qui prévaudront au moment
do la Conférence. Avant sa réunion, il sera nécessaire de faire
un travail assez considérable tant technique que politique, ri
est évident,qn effet, que la convention ne vaudra que par les
chiffres qui seront insérés dans les tableaux.
M. AVENOL est d’avis que le cadre de la convention représente un progrès considérable par rapport à celui qui avait été esquissé lors des réunions antérieures. Il y a lieu de signaler en particulier, l’article qui prévoit la création d’une commission permanente du désarmement. En outre, les gouvernements et les
J
Administrations savent maintenant de quelle manière ce cadre doit
4
être rempli, ce qui circonscrit nettement pour eux l’étude du problème. En ce qui concerne le travail du Secrétariat,
M. Avenol tient à s1 associer aux félicitations qui ont été exprimées, la veille, par la Commission,
III,	M. HAAS signale que la conférence sur l’unification du droit fluvial s’était réunie dans des conditions qui oi rendaient la réussite très douteuse. Après 25 jours de débats
difficiles, elle a abouti à un succès complet. Trois conventions ont été conclues et presque tous les états intéressés ont signé la convention la plus importante» Ce succès est de bon .augure pour les travaux ultérieurs visant à l’unification technique ou
juridique en Europe,
Il y a lieu de signaler également au'après de longues discussions la conférence a décidé de joindre au texte de la
convention établi dans les deux langues officielles, un texte en langue allemande, ce texte devant faire foi pour les états qui décident de l’adopter entre eux. Ce système intéressant e été adopté dans des conditions très spéciales, mais il n’est pas impossible que des situations analogues se présentent à l’avenir.

Directors' Meeting Paper 3.1930.
NOTE 3Y THESECRETARY-GENERAL.
This question was discussed at a Latin-American meeting on January 7th. It was decided, however, in view of the fact that the proposals made by M. Mencia affect all Sections of the Secretariat, that the matter should be referred for final consideration to a Directors' Meeting. The document is therefore circulated for this purpose.

THE WRITING OP LEAGUE DOCUMENTS.
Note by tho Secretary-General.
The attached note might be discussed at a Directors’ Meeting to bo held some little time before the next session of the Council.
(Initialled) E.D.
The Publications Committee at its meeting of February 24th, considered a note by Major Buxton on T,0ur Authors”.
The Committee agreed with the suggestions made by Major Buxton and proposed that the question should be submitted to a directors’ meeting.
February 28th, 1930
Our authors.
It is no doubt difficult to attain in an international organisation a really high standard of writing, but it seems to me that me are not taking nearly enough trouble to get our reports written by people who can write. I do not believe that the language difficulty is nearly so great as is often supposed. Two of the best written documents that I have seen in the last few months were in neither care written by people whose mother tongue is English or French. One is by a Dutchman in English and the other by a Roumanian in French«
They are a happy contrast to many others - some of the worst of which were in my opinion by people writing in their own language.
It may be argued that this can be put right by editing.
In many c;	ases	it	cannot. It can be nut	right	by burning or by
rewriting	and	by	nothing less.		
	I h	ave	recently seen a general	report	divided into
chapters on different subjects, written by a number of authors.
The result is naturally lack of balance between the chapters and general unevenness. Some of the chapters are obviously written by people who know/	exactly what they want	to say and how to	say it.
Others are written	by people whose talent	does not	lie with	pen
or pencil, however	well they may know the	subject.
It was, I think, found that the	only way	to produce a
satisfactory report by the Secretary-General to the Assembly was to put the work in the hands of one man who got his information from the Sections and wrote the whole report himself, That sort of plan might, I suggest, be followed more/ than it is in the Section. We have the talent here but in many cases it is not being used and we seem to be asking people haphazard to turn their hand to work for which they would probably admit they never had an inclination or an aptitude.
The Translating Department and a good many other members of the Secretariat must know pretty well by now where talent in writing lies and where it does not, and I suggest that right through the Secretariat we should choose with far greater care the authors of any document which leaves this building.	It is of course far more difficult
and often imioossible to ensure that League reports by authors outside the Secretariat shall be written by skilled hands; but here too I think we might avoid more than we do indifferent writers and employ the good ones.

To the Secretary-General.-
Records of Committee meetings.
I think it might he worth while to discuss the various methods of taking records of meetings and try to eiolve a more regular system. Several experiments have recently been made in taking verbatim records and some are also being made in the other direction, i.e.. in simply having a short record taken by a precis-writer, not for circulation, but to be kept for reference and help in drafting the report. Between these two extremes come ordinary fairly full Minutes. The Financial Committee now has verbatim records of their proceedings and its members and the Section think this is more satisfactory than their past Minutes. On the other hand, where verbatim records were taken of committees of the Economic Truce Conference, the result is not, I understand, considered at all satisfactory, either by the Economic Section or the precis-writers, who have had great difficulty in putting them into shape. The Enquiry Committee on Intellectual Co-operation and the Committee on Ratifications have merely had an unpublished record to he^p in drafting their report; the Veterinary Committee will probably do the same.
The amount of subsequent work Involved by verbatim records is a serious matter, but of course the main thing is to get a good report cf the meeting and in some cases no doubt it should be verbatim, Ear the body which has to take the final decision, such as the Council, a report condensing the results is probably much the most convenient document on which to work.
It is not easy to lay down a general rule, but I suggest the following:
(1} For plenary meetings of diplomatic Conferences, for their main commissions and for any other important meetings composed of Government delegates
verbatim or full minutes, whichever the Secretariat,
in consultation with the Chairman, thinks advisable.
(2) For committees of a consultative character, i.e., committees composed of persons not officieUy representing their Governments, as well as for committees of experts, special committees, drafting committees, etc., one of the two fo'llowing methods:
(a)	short record to be kept by precis-writers, shown to secretary of committee, not circulated but kept for use of Secretariat in drafting report;
(b)	summary of the proceedings to be sent out to members at the end of the session. This would be a summarised record established by the responsible Section on the basis of short minutes taken down
by a precis-writer, (*)
■» Explanation.
A precis-Writer would take down minutes in the ordinary manner, and send them in manuscript to the responsible Section. The Section would summarise them, arrange the discussion according to subjects, have the records translated, roneod and distributed to the committee, as final records.. The advantages being shorter minutes and only one te-production by the roneo department.
Perhaps this might be discussed, meeting after the Council.

MOTE SUR UN PPOJET D
EXPOSITION PERMANENTE
A I,’INTERIEUR DU SECRETARIAT, D’UNS SUR LE FONCTIONNEMENT ET L'OEUVRE DE LA
DOCUMENTATION SOCIETE DES NATIONS.
La Société des Nations a toujours été, depuis qu'elle existe, un objet de curiosité des touristes et des voyageurs étrangers qui passent par Genève et qui souvent même viennent spécialement à Genève pour voir la Société des Nations. Le flot de ces visiteurs a considérablement augmenté ces dernières années et il n’est pas rare, pendant les mois d’été notamment, que le Secrétariat reçoive la visite chaque jour de 100 à 150 personnes. Or, dans l’état actuel du Secrétariat il n'y a que fort peu de choses à montrer à ces visiteurs qui parcourent des corridors et des salles de comités vides. Nombre d'entre eux viennent de très loin et s’en retournent un peu désappointés.
Il paraît donc nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour remédier à cette situation. Il se trouve que, dans les dernières années, plusieurs sections du Secrétariat (La Section d’Hygiène, la Section des Communications et du Transit, la Section d'information) ont, à l'occasion d'expositions internationales consacrées à des sujets spéciaux, préparé une documentation très intéressante se composant de graphiques, de cartes, de photographies, de collections de publications, etc. La Section d'information se demande s1il ne serait pas possible d'utiliser cette documentâtinn en la complétant au besoin,- ce qui pourrait se faire à peu de frais,- pour satisfaire, dans une certaine mesure au moins, la curiosité légitime des visiteurs.
s
Le Secrétariat ne disposant pas de local approprié (l’emplacement qui se trouve sous la salle du Conseil et qui donne sur le lac est envahi par l’humidité et ne peut être employé dans ce but), la Section d'information propose d'utiliser à cet effet les salles (à l'exception de la salle du Conseil) et couloirs du rez-de-chaussée. Le matériel d'exposition n'occuperait que les surfaces murales et ainsi ne réduirait pas l'espace déjà restreint dont disposent les différents comités eu commissions de la Société des Nations. Pour éviter tout dérangement, les visites continueraient à avoir lieu, comme par le passé, en dehors des heures de réunion des commissions ou comités.
On pourrait au besoin utiliser les corridors des différents étages du Secrétariat pour y disposer le matériel que l'on n'aurait pas pu placer dans les salles et corridors du rez-do-chaus-sêe. Le public n’étant admis qu'en dehors des heures de bureau, les fonctionnaires du Secrétariat ne seraient pas plus dérangés que par le passé.
La Section d 'Information se rend bien compte que la solution qu'elle propose n'est pas parfaite, mais elle aurait au moins cet avantage de donner à peu de frais un surcroît d'intérêt à la visite du Secrétariat.

(b) Seront réservées, pour être renvoyées à 1Texamen préalable du Bureau, les questions suivantes:
Question n° 4
Rapport au Comité des Cinq concernant les dispositions en vue de 1'Assemblée :
( TjS Bureau aura à examiner comment 1T Assemblée pourra être appelée à discuter les propositions du Comité des cinq et à se prononcer sur ses conclusions, le Bureau pourra soit envisager la possibilité du renvoi à une Cornais si on -(cas d'amendement au Règlement intérieur-)-, soit juger plus opportun de renvoyer la question à 1'Assemblée siégeant in plenus. Dans ce dernier cas, il fixera la séance à laquelle cette question devra figurer à i1ordre du jour et la forme sous laquelle la discussion sera introduite).
Question n °_5
Augmentation du nombre des vice-présidents de l'Assemblée.
(Amendement proposé an paragraphe I, article 7 du Règlement
intérieur de l'Assemblée).
(l'Assemblée devra se prononcer en séance plénière par un vote sur le piojet d'amendement dont elle est régulièrement saisie; il appartiendra au Bureau d'examiner à quelle séance cette question devra figurer à l'ordre du jour).
Question 7
Election des membres de la Commission de contrôle.
(le Bureau aura à déterminer comment il sera procédé au tirage au sort des deux membres de la Commission de contrôle dont le mandat prendra fin. Tenant compte de la proposition présentée p<- r le Gouvernement suisse concernant la non-réégibilité des membres de la Commission de contrôle, le Bureau estimera probablement devoir suspendre ses dispositions jusqu'à la décision de la 4ème Commission).
Question n® 2o (Doc, A, 7. u-:...G. V)
Démission de il. Charles Evans Hughes, juge à la Cour permanente de Justice internationale : Question de la nomination d'un
successeur pour la durée du Mandat de U. Hughes, qui vient à expiration le ¿>1 décembre 1930. (Article 14 uu Statut de la Cour permanente).
Question rxJ 24 (Doc. A. 14.1930.V)
Election des membres ue la Cour permanente de Justice internationale pour neuf années à dater du 1er janvier 1931, conformément aux dispositions du Statut ae la Cour permanente.
{La piocédur-e pour ces deux élections devant être conforme aux précédents, le Bureau se bornera probablement à envisager la date à laquelle il devra être procédé au vote simultané du Conseil et de l'Assemblée),
Ces diverses questions seront renvoyées au Bureau, sur
la proposition du Président* Il s'y ajoutera la
Question n° 3
Election de trois membres non permanents du Conseil.
(Le Bureau sera appelé à fixer la séance ou il sera procédé à cette élection. Dans la règle, elle devrait avoir lieu le lundi suivant 1Touverture de la session, mais comme la présente session s'ouvrira un mercredi au lieu d'un, lundi, ie Bureau devra, envisager soit de maintenir la règle et par suite, fixer les élections au lundi, 15 septembre, soit cl1 y déroger et, pour maintenir l'intervalle dTune semaine, renvoyer les élections au mercredi suivant la date de l'ouverture de la session, soit le 17 septembre 1930).
(c)	Questions renvoyées par le Conseil.
Àiux questions figurant à l'ordre du jour de l'Assemblée s'ajoutent, en général, celle que le Conseil au cours de sa session précédant immédiatement l'Assemblée, renvoie à celle-ci Jusqu'ici, aucune question de ce genre n'a été signalée Selon l'usage, le Président au Conseil devra faire parvenir une lettre à ce sujet au. Président de i'Assemblée lors ae l'ouverture de la session afin que le Président puisse proposer la

LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
Directors1 Meeting Paper 12.1930.
usa OF EXPRESSION f< STATES MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERSn.
To the Secretary-General.
Hay I raise a point which has struok me rather increasingly lately?
It goes without saying, of course, that we ought to do everything we can to strengthen the general conception of League universality, and take whatever precautions are possible against the spread of the idea that a considerable number of States are still outside the League.
There seems to have developed recently, however, a tendency to use the phrase "States Members and non-Members of the League n, as in the attached opium document*, or TTany Member of the league or non-Member State", as in the attached ratification document**. The expressions are, of course, quite accurate juridically, but may lead, to the growing up of a rather unfortunate psychological tendency. It would seem to me not to be in League interest to accentuate the idea that there are two types of States in the world, States Members of the League and States non-Members.	It would seem easy to avoid this by
using the far simpler phrase "all States".
{initialled) A. S.
The phrase is used nearly altogether in league resolutions and circular letters. It hardly seems capable to me of producing the psychological effect suggested, but as Hr. Sweetser is a good judge of the point, the paper might be sent round to U.S.G.Ts and Directors and put on the agenda of a Directors* meeting for consideration.

M. Avene1.
It seems to me intolerable that our printing staff should have to work uninterruptedly for these periods0 If they are forced to work all night, they should be given the day off before, which can only be done if the Section gives 48 hours notice.	I know that we must expect at
times to work long extra hours, but Sections are much too prone to make impossible demands on the central services.
I do not believe in circular letters, and think the best plan would be to raise the question at the first Directors’ Meeting in the New Year.
Major Buxton.
May I draw your attention to a system in tbe Secretariat which tends to upset the organisation of the
the year at top speed - MSS come late and are urgent.
In making delivery promises my assistant or I can only base our calculations on tbe amount of work in hand plus e certain margin for unforeseen, very urgent, documents. It has now happened in three successive weeks that, for conferences, tbe Printing Department has bad to work day and night, without previous warning. The following

Navigation intérieure, Acte final et trois Conventions.
(Pas de numéros.)
Some of these documents, as for instance C.P.D.29£(1), contained difficult tables which had even to be reset twice. Result: Mr. Graham worked on several occasions a complete day and a complete night up to 26 hours; the printer had to ask Ms workmen to do over 20 hours uninterrupted work; and at the end of one strenuous day and night some workmen declared that they were unable to carry on, and the progress of the work was seriously hampered.
On one cr two occasions nearly all my printing staff was occupied day and night with this conference work, with the result that even more concentrated efforts on the work promised for the end of the year are necessary, with, of course, a doubt as to their being finished in time.
A further serious difficulty - one that is perhaps unavoidable - is that whereas MSS coming from Conference Drafting Commi flees are promised for a certain hour, they are often delayed two, three or even four hours by the Committee's deliberations:	no grace, however, is given to the Printing
Department, end delivery at 7 a.m. is still exacted.
I would propose:
1) that a letter to the following effect be sent to the Section concerned: when a Conference is likely to finish and the printing of resolutions, reports or conventions is likely
3
to be required, a warning should be given to me or to C-raham, in writing, at least 48 hours before.
g)	The Section should be warned that at any time other than the Assembly the Printing Department has a limited staff, and that Sections cannot expect to have extensive documents produced in one night.
Sections sometimes overlook, also, when giving night work, to inform the Distribution and the secretary of the Publications Committee - despite the fact that the regulations ask for this to be done. This last point might also be mentioned in a letter - not, however, a circular letter, as these do not make the slightest impression on those mainly concerned.

2.	The correspondence with the Chinese authorities and with our friends in Peiping which ensued resulted in c. telegraphic request, addressed to you on September 14th, 19297 by the Foreign minister of the Chinese National Government for a '‘'’Commission of Experts from the He -1th Organisation of the League of Nations to make a survey on port health and maritime quarantine'5. After examining this request, the Council decided that full assistance should be given to China in her efforts towards development, and you instructed me, in consultation with the President of the Health Committee, to proceed to China with one or two Secretariat experts in order to discuss with the competent authorities a detailed project to be submitted to the Health Committee.
3.	Dr. Boudreau, Mr. You Sao-fong and myself, accompanied by Mr. Mellor, secretary-shorthand-typist, sailed from Cherbourg on October 4th, 1929.
We stopped for four days in Tokyo to discuss with Professor Nagayo, the Japanese Member of the Health Committee, and with the Central Sanitary Bureau, the details of our collaboration in the study of Leprosy, Infant Mortality and Port Health practice, of the establishment of a centre of documentation at the Eastern Bureau, and the Japanese membership of the new Health Committee.
We learned from the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, to whom we explained the official origin of our Mission and the Assembly ana Council discussions thereon, that the Japanese Government viewed with satisfaction the League’s commencement of technical collaboration with China, and hoped it would extend to other fields besides health.
No met Mr. Sugimura and Mr. Cummings at Kyoto, where we were able to establish useful contacts, while carefully abstaining from attending - even informally -any meetings or discussions of the Conference. To failed in our attempts to meet again either Mr. Sugimura or Mr. Cummings during their visits to China in December.
CHIN A.
On arrival in Shanghai on November 9th, 1929, we were inf*med by the Minister of Health that, in addition to a preliminary survey of the quarantine arrangements at certain ports (Shanghai, Tientsin, Dairen, An lung., Tsingtao, Amoy and Canton) and an examination of the steps to be taken for the establishment of a National
-Z-
ouarantine Service, he would desire us to undertake a general study of the organisation and functioning of medical and sanitary institutions in various special municipalities and administrative divisions (Greater Shanghai, Nanking, Vusih, Hrngchow, Tientsin, Peiping and Canton) with particular reference to medical education, to the training of sanitary personnel, to the status of a provincial health organisation, to the activities of the National Epidemic Diseases Prevention Bureau and to the problem of the control of ohclera and smallpox in the Shanghai area.
The object of our mission thus defined, we felt that this preliminary study should serve to provide us with such essential information as would be required, on the one hand, by the Chinese Government and, on the other, by yourself and the Health Committee, regarding specific problems in which our collaboration could be available.
is to the efficacy of league so tion.
Our first efforts were directed towards ascertaining whether tangible improvements in sanitary conditions wer . likely to result within r reasonable lapse of time after such .assistance in health matters as the League could now render.
Difficulties:	If this undertaking were tr bo national in scope, the
Nc stalls- difficulties would be stupendous, t'i c s,
N# sanita-	Although deaths are at present recorded nowhere with
tion.	even approximate accuracy, mortality would appear to be
higher in Chins than anywhere else in the world. Infant mortality is reliably stated to bo very high, although, through inveterate habit, there is general reluctance to report biriifc«, even in a rudimentary fashion. Epidemic disease is rampant in many of the Provinces. In the best administerod area, namely, Shanghai (Chinese and Foreign), Gholsrn makes s periodical appearance and is periodically rs-distributsd throughout tho For East, and smallpox is ondsmio. The epidemic prevalence elsewhere, widespread as it must be, cs.n only be glimpsed from scanty intelligence supplied by the few hospitals;, yet control measures which are recognisod as really indispensable can only be based on a knowledge of the real situation. In one notable instance, namely, in regard to pneumonic» plague in the North East, such measures have been taken and continue to be applied successfully.
Neither large or small towns possess either reliable water supplies or the most elementary sewerage systems.
Floating populations living on tens of thousands of house-boats in canals, rivers and creeks, even in the heart of wealthy cities, need land accommodation and drinking-water, if real oontrol of water-borne diseases is to be effected.
Millions and millions of the urban and rural population must be housed, however primitively at least in habitable dwellings, before any health education and sanitary propaganda can become really effective and uncleanly habits, tho heritage of forty centuries of conservative custom, be •verccme.
-3-
Laok cf doctors; defective nedical education.
Economic and social reconstruction comes first.
Modern medicine is fighting gallently for recognition among a people in whose original civilisation hospitals had no place. There are at presant not more than 500 or 600 foreign hospitals functioning throughout the whole country, the majority - with some notable exceptions - being inadequate missionaiy institutions; only a dozen or so are efficient Chinese hospitals. Oven in great cities like Peiping, Shanghai, Tientsin, Hankow, Hangchow, Canton, provision of public medical relief is either totally lacking or quite inadequate. In the interior of the country it is denied to the bulk of the population.
At the most, four thousand doctors - mostly inadequately trained or not trained at all, practice 'Isstern medicine, usually in or around the Treaty Forts, in foreign Concessions and the larger cities. The efficient minority hardly exceeds one thousand and is, with a few exceptions, generally commercialised. Moreover, it is «rouped by language associations (Hnglish, German, French, Japanese) according to the doctor’s foreign technical affiliations, thus rendering corporate action, hospital work and medical instruction still more difficult.
Medical education is lamentably inadequate and the few higher or good-standard schools, foreign or Chinese, have produced up to the present only a few leaders, and they graduate every year t relatively small, sometimes quite negligible, number of students.
In fact, though rapidly gaining ground, modern medicine is still strange and unfamiliar to the masses. The native art of healing had its golden age in the 12th and 13th centuries B.C and its progress since then has been slow and reluctant. Tc---d. y the more up-to-date of these "practitioners 1 have acquired the jargon of Testern medicine and probably attained the level and popularity of his fellow quacks who now abound in such variety in the Vest.
His clientele probably does not differ greatly from theirs. The poorer and more ignorant species of these "healers”, of whom hundreds of thousands must exist, provide the only "medical relief" (based on archaic customs) which is available for the millions. The more prosperous "healer", however, caters for the upper and middle classes and sometimes even for the leaders of the country - again not unlike his bestern colleagues,
But were the progress of Testern medicine never so rapid, the sanitary rehabilitation of the country could never gain upon the pace of economic reconstruction. The attainment of a modern standard of public health, however, moderate, is necessarily as dependent upon the economic and financial development of the country as upon the success of the educational effort, end on a reasonable degree of political stability.
Major measures of sanitation and alleviation of the housing misery in chief towns might easily be begun, and could in fact be followed fairly rapidly by tangible efforts, if it were feasible to finance such schemes; but at present this is denied.

It vas hoped that, with the establishment of the political ascendency of the Kuomintang over the Forth, the Chinese Devolution would enter upon the stage of "organising its conquests', and make systematic efforts at economic and social reconstruction. Dor the first time an effective central Government over an apparently united China was in the hands of a modern group of young leaders, many recently returned from university studies in the West, usually Am- rice., and sugar to carry out a comprehensive programme of far-reaching reform. They owed their power to the success of the mass movement.
They loarned the technique of its conduct from a close, if abruptly severed, association with a group of Soviet advisors, who added boldness to the programme, and endeavoured to infuse new aims by fitting it into n sweeping measure of land reforms and a widespread £md militant campaign of social and national emancipation through the newly formed trades unions.
Hven when the Soviet advisers had left and the Government was definitely established at Nanking, the impetus of the Revolution was net spent. The programmes had yet to be elaborated in a turmoil of party discussions which, although fought out under the banner of 'Left" and : ight' wings, continued in essence to centre round the issue of the capture of power - leaving plans of reform and social policies floating in the realm of generalisation, together with the abstract theory of the "Three Principles of the People". The elaboration of detailed plans was left to the creative genius, ardour and ingenuity of a nucleus "Civil Service'’, composed of earnest social workers drawn to Funking bp hopes of a Government dirested by returned 'western students, and by the prospect of t he "Doctor’s" principles being put into practice by "an enlightened bureaucracy1' during the second period of "tutelage of the people" which was officially nroclaimed as having begun.
Though the Kuomintang might not keep faith with Dr.
Sun Yat Sen's classification of the revolutionary era into the three periods of "military conquest’' (terminating presumably with the occupation of Peiping and the raising on the Nationalist flag by the bar Lord of Manchuria) , of "political tutelage", and the distant final stage of "’government by the people”, no Central Government in China would dare yet to relinquish the exercise of arbitrary

power over the territories under its sway. The position of the present Government needed to be made secure against the rapacity of the Northern Militarists and the internecine struggle within the Party.
The North hoisted the Kuomintang colours in recognition of national unity and of a common front towards foreign countries. But it maintains its suspicion^ of the Southern radicalism, is intensely jealoüs of the* transfer of the capital to Nanking, which carries with it the control of the wealthiest, most modern and easily tare dm car: of the country; and it assuredly aims at wresting the sceptre of office from its oresent holders and reverting the old methods of political bargaining as between a few War Lords sharing control over the entire country. The "model" Tuchun of Shansi Yen ITsi-shan, is to-day the unavowed exponent of this tendency. Tchang Hsue-Liang, the morbid, feeble ruler of Manchuria would, of course, follow his lead but ’rowi'; take no initiative. The myth of the powerful Manchurian Army was twice exploded - once when it fled before the Southern advance on Peiping, and again recently, when it melted igneminiously before a few Bed raiders during the dispute with Russia over the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, Yen Shi-Shan ostensibly supports Chang Kai - shek’s government as at present constituted, because he dreads the advent to power of the "Lefts". Ee receives a handsome reward for his amity, both in the form of cash and in extension of his territorial sphere of influence, but he is the real and most dangerous opponent of any effective Kuomint an g Government.
His actual military strength is a mystery as his armies seldom if ever fight and take the field outside their own territory only to succour the victors and to extract the price of neutrality or alliance. But to dislodge him from his own provinces would take probably a year or two of hard struggle.
Peng Yu-bkiang,the "Christian" General, while he is a Northern military leader and an opponent of the present Government, is certainly more closely related to them than to Yen Hsi-shan, who dreads him almost as much as he dreads the "Lefts". Feng commands a real fighting force of his own and it may be the consciousness of his own striking power, of the attraction which his magnetic personality and solid achievements in road-building, establishing schools, guaranteeing security and generally carrying out measures for the emancipation of the people, continue to exercise over the minds cf many leaders and groups in modern China, which made him openly rebel against Nanking. Rebellions have been a recognized method for centuries of settling political disputes in China, and it is Feng's propensity to follow this well-worn procedure which made.him a "Northern ’ illtarist" and alienated the sympathy of many former followers.

Chong1 s difficulties, end of 1929.
Unfortunately there was a certain amount of truth in their charges. Uhile the momentum f the Revolution was not spent when the Soviet advisers left China and when 1 ter the "Lefts” were forced out of power, the Government, f'r ed from any control oy the opposition, and ruthlessly suppressing oil political criticism as "communist" or "anti-revolutionary", soon began to lose its original driving force; eventually, after tub years of office, little remained of the early schemes of reconstruction; the top-he-ovy im chinery of the Centro.1 Government was clogged oy the defensive -„t tut id of those holding doggedly on to o:- i'icial positions, and real incentive to reform and reconstruction pa: sed more and more into tie campof the Opposition. These c lied themselves "Reorganis-tionists" and repeatedly disclaimed any con ection with . oscow or loc.. 1 co. munist p.-rties.
But all attempts at making their cl..ins known or their criticisms heard were repressed with a he:, vy had by the Patty caucus, and they were gradually driven into cover - thus increasing tenfold td.eir attraction for malcontents uiia enemies oi the Government. .my overtures to reconciliation ‘were blocked - principally by Hu Han-min, (who had r-tamed from Lurope greatly impressed by the European dictators..ips) -.rUi his associates who held an absolute majority in the Central Executive Committee.
Finally, when Feng openly attached the Government, the 'Reorgunis tionists" also struck, first in the Yungtzse Valley, t .rough the rebellion of the "Ironsides" under Ch -ng-F- t-Kwei, ana then moving ho :th in the hope of capturing Canton and the 'Province of Hwangtung.
Owing to the swift counter-action of tne government Ts troops, its opponents were defeated in the field after a hard struggle, in which Chang Kai-Shek received the su ort oi the old reactionary eaement. against Feng Yu-Hsi ng tne Government scored some real successes in hand fighting under German leadership, but the issue was fin. ly decided in the first campaign (October-DTov-eir,ber) 1929), by buying over the brig_.nu troops. home of these brig-nds were then ordered South .g in t Ch-ng Fat-Kwei, out re jelled in their turn, ..nu i or a few days had it in their power to seise K-nking ii they chose.

8.	Definite improvement in the he a it... conditions of China depends on uncertain f-ctors, some beyond the control of the national Government, and it is obvious that no assist nee from the League at the present time would enable a decisive chan re in the sanitary situation to be made v/ituin a reasonable oeiiod.
T is being so, would It -o r that the League ’ s action is justifiable, and, if so , win t should be its scope and limits?
It would be doubtful wisdom to el. oor.tc a general scheme of sanitary reconstruction for the whole country in the absence or reii.bie data as a basis . -cc urate information must be sought by me-ns of exploration and surveys, while a tentative application of preliminary schei.es in selected localities should reveal appropriate met oas of solving the numerous heaitn problems.
It is considered that the League c. n render useful service in this preparatory .orb „nich, in our view, can only be accomplished by gradual stages.
The necessary prelimin. ry survey, to determine tire scope of the prcol m. and t. . human imteri .1 avail-Die, we have, we believe, been able to c-rry out.
It appears necass-ry fi.st to form _n efiicient headquarters staff b.-- the establishment of tae necessary technical institution ior the piacticalstuuy of elementary oroolems, ana by simultaneous application in the field, in two or three districts o.i a sufi icien cmy large sc le to serve as a nation-wide training fiela, yet limited within the bounds of practicability.

- ,?uçh a Pr°Srairitae implies the délits, rate abandonment oi^ambitious schemes covering the whole cauntrv, and the determination to concentrate on a few fundamental issues in the provinces and cities where conditions are favourable,
We believe we have been instrumental in inducing the Executive Yuan to adopt this programme on behalf of the Ministry of Health. The attached correspondence with the Ministers of Health and of Education shows that the assistance of the League is now requested in the élabora cion and application of a detailed plan along the lines described
cl 00V6 ©
Its expansion can only be slow, It will depend both cn the qualities of leadership, of determination and the spirit of service displayed by the small team of responsible Chinese technical officers, and on the material resources controlled by the Central Government and the local authorities concerned„
Chinese to bo laorally and financially responsible.
The success of the undertaking rests upon tee sense of responsibility shown by the Chinese officers in charge of the plan. In the field of Western medicine and public health the Chinese leaders, in spite of the existing mood of somewhat aggressive nationalism, have relied too exclusively upon foreign institutions. Missionaries, philanthropic agenoies and foreign Governments, all anxious to exert influence, have taken 'the responsibility out of Chinese hands by setting up themselves, financing and directing numerous institutions, with the result that there are to-day few Chinese nodical officers with sufficient exprience to organise, direct and budget for their own undertakings. Nor has this period cf foreign tutelage been sufficiently utilised, for the setting up of the requisite standards; while certain of the institutions are of a high standard, the rest cannot bo looked upon as models for tho Chinese.
These institutions, if they are to be an integral part of Chinese social life, must emerge from a real effort on the part of the Chinese themselves.
Having asertained that this view was fully shared by the Minister of Health and his associates, we assured them of the League’s assistance, £n the form of technical counsel and detailed advice in the establishment and initial work of a few institutions of ''strategic” importance for the subsequent development cf their plan of sanitary reconstruction. Y/e discussed details of a scheme for submission to the Health Committee which included the detailing of one of our own medical officers to the new Held Health Service in Shanghai, to act as technical adviser, probably for a period of two years.
But wTe insisted that no Governmental plan would be accepted as genuine abroad unless the Chinese Government undertook financial responsibility for it. We found the Minister of Finance quite willing to provide one million Mexican dollars for the establishment of the institutions. He showed complete sympathy with the plan and fully appreciated the moral value of this investment, both at heme and abroad. He promised to make over the sum in not
-12-
mc re than six monthly instalments to a Board of Trustees composed of public-spirited citizens, together with technical officers of the Ministries of Finance and of Health, The Ministers of Railways, of Commerce, of Education, and of Foreign Affairs, all expressed their full concurrence and made suggestions as to the details of application.
We were particularly gratified to find these leading Ministers, and in particular the Minister of Finance (nominally the Chief of such quarantine stations as are operated at present by the Chinese Customs) fully .accept the views repeatedly expounded by us as to the necessity of securing the confidence and the goodwill of foreign sanitary administrations in the reoonstruction-al effort, both by the establishment of a modernised quarantine service and by internal health development. These Ministers appeared to realise the services which the League can render China in this direction.
Would successive Governments maintain arrangements with League?
We were assured by competent and well-informed foreign observers, by numerous independent Chinese leaders (some of them hostile to the present (Government) and finally by outspoken members of the Government itself, that a plan of cooperation between the League and the present Government in the field of reconstruction would without a doubt be honoured by their successors,whether Northern militarists or Southern "Lefts".
But are there at the present time material possibilities for the realisation of any plan of reconstruction?
Can the active participation of provincial and municipal authorities be relied upon?
Potentialities. In spite of civil war, of political instability and economic crises, the intellectual, economic and social life of the community continues to develop, adopting various db thods for "surviving" effects of internal warfare and incessant administrative interference. The country seems, lik& the agricultural States in Europe, to possess the power of rapid recovery.
The Railways are earning large net profits, even during continuous military activities. On certain lines three months of indisturbed operation more than cover the annual expenses. The unification of railway administration under the Ministry of Railways was successfully effected in especially difficult conditions, and a number of improvements have already been realised in the present railway system.
For the first time, a central government has been able to elaborate a modern national budget which was approved for 1929 by the Financial Advisory Committee, in consultation with most of the Provinces. A new Central Bank of China was formally opened by the Nanking Government in November, 1928. The bank is required to keep cash
-13-
reserves at 60 per cent, and security reserves at 40 per cent, of the total note issue, examinations of which are periodically conducted by the Supervisory Committee.
By October 31, 1929, 34 examinations had been made by the committee and the results made public, showing in each case that the correct reserves were cn hand.
Branches of the Central Bank were opened in various Provinces. Great and successful efforts were made in the direction of collecting taxes. Radical reforms were introduced in the administration of foreign loans and domestic loans were successfully handled; it is stated that
e Wanking Government domestic issues have not shown e slightest default. All this nas been accomplished
desnite incredible difficulties in the Ministep of Pin-ancb’s path, due to continuous military operaticns Ifor
which 40 per cent, of the Government's total estimated 1929 revenue and 36 per cent, of its estimated gross
expenditures in the first National Budget were taken). However, the banks dispose of large reserves ready for investment whenever political stability appears more or less secured.
Roads are under construction in several provinces, even those under "medaeval'1 war lords, particularly in the southern and central provinces. In 1921 less than 100 miles of roads suitable for motor traffic existed in all China, excluding those in foreign concessions and the 800-mile caravan route to Mongolia. An estimate of the National Government Roads Association in June 1929 showed the existence of 20,973 miles of improved highways, with 3,764 miles under construction. Wireless and aviation are being developed by foreign contracts, under active Chinese control, while rapid progress has been effected in the administration of posts, telegraphs and telephones.
Cities continue to be modernised superficially, streets are being widened and, in certain towns, kept in a clean state; town-planning schemes are being drawn up under foreign, sometimes very costly, supervision; housing projects are shyly taking shape here and there, and generous plans are being made for the future.
In the field of agriculture, cooperative societies, universities as well as the Central Government itself, are all assisting in the provision of easier rural credits and improved marketing conditions. An increasing number of Chinese experts is being trained at hone and abroad to carry out work in scientific agriculture and rural economics. Special commissions are studying large-scale conservation and irrigation projects in various parts of the country.
Of the comprehensive programme drawn up by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Labour, the following legislation has already been adopted; protection of foreign trademarks (a long-needed measure); reduction of child labour and encouragement of 8-hour day in factories; regulations for organisation and activities of labour unions* Measures are also in hand, under expert advice, for chambers of commerce, business concerns, cooperative stores, arbitration of industrial disputes, standardisation of

weights and measures, patent and insurance laws.
Efforts to popularise Chinese manufactured, goods led. to the large and successful industrial exhibition at Shanghai in 1928, in which 15 Provinces participated, which was followed by otler more ambitious efforts, notably the exhibition of Chinese products at Hangchow in 1929, which included 20,000 exhibits, dealing with numerous phases of Chinese life and including a foreign section.
Social reform is being seriously studied, though achievements are still small. Municipal bureaux of social welfare seem to be in capable hands even in cities under backward management.
But it is the educational movement which presents the most encouraging aspects. Elementary instruction which is the responsibility of the local authorities is making rapid progress in the four or five progressive provinces (Kiangsu, Kiansu, Chekiang, Kmantung and Honan)
In Chekiang, sixteen thousand schools were functioning in 1928, with 528,381 children in regular attendance.
In Kiangsu the attendance approximated 556,000 children. Similar figures for the remaining "select” provinces are available. The sale of all primary and secondary modern textbooks has practically doubled between 1918 and 1928.
It was estimated in 1922/23 that 178,972 modern schools of all grades, attended by some 1,8IUQ000 students, were functioning in that your. On the basis of the total number of modern text-books sold during 1928, it was estimated that approximately 12 million Chinese students were enrolled in all modern schools that year, and, taking all types of school into consideration, the maximum would approach 20 million, namely, about 5 per cent, of the population, as against 15 per cent, in Japan and 25 per cent, in the United States.
The desire for education in fact appears to be widespread, and there is a shortage of primary school teachers; while normal training schools, of which there exist about 25, are obliged to refuse admission to candidates.
Middle-school training, defective and low-grade as it is, still produces many more graduates than can bo admitted to the national and other universities of good standard. The rejected candidates of both sexes flock to private high-schools of the lower type, which abound in large citios and are reported to be flourishing enterprises.
The national universities are passing through a period of intense revival and development. They appear to be under the management of zealous and energetic young workers, with a few notable exceptions, of the Y.E.C.A. type and intellectual standard.
Departments of education are springing up at national universities, chiefly under the guidance of .American-trained students, eager for outlet for their aspirations rather than for lucrative employment.

The "Mass Bducation Movement”.
The Gentral Chinese Academy, with an annual "budget od 1,200,000 dollars, is actively organising and developing various research institutes: (Meteorological, astronomical, chemical, biological, physiological etc.)
The geological survey of China is continuing its really monumental work under particulairly competent Chinese technical management.
The federation of a number of university schools and institutes is under way in Feiping, under the leadership cf a prominent scholar-politician. The Metropolitan Library and the Palace Museum in eiping are ably managed by competent and experienced scientists.
But in addition to these institutions, supported by the Central or local Governments, or by grants from the China Board (administering the American Boxer Indemnity returned for educational purposes), private initiative and individual effort are responsible for some really remarkable achievements.
The TTankai University at Tientsin, due to the initiative and unswerving energy of Dr. Chang Po-lin, and built entirely from Chinese donations and endowments, would do credit as a provincial university tc any6ountry. It is magnificently houses, provided with an abundant (though almost exclusively American-British) library and maintains its own middle- and higher-boarding schools for several hundred boys and a separate one for 500 girls. It was established and developed within the space cf fifteen years; it collects over one million dollars annually from Chinese subscribers.
Comparable with Nankai University in singleness of purpose and spirit of service there is the "Mass Bducation Movement” and the Hsiao-Chunang Normal School of Dr.
Tao Chin-sing.
Started by a Y.M.C.A. Secretary who was in spiritual charge of Chinese coolie labour parties in Prance during the war, the movement aimed at combatting adult and adolescent illiteracy by the introduction of a simplified alphabet which could be learned by a farmer-boy or coolie in a three months’ course cf evening classes. This simplified alphabet was duly compiled and the library of pamphlets and tracts published in this script are now yearly circulated in hundreds of thousands of copies.
By 1925 there were some 54,000 evening classes in full swing, and officials of the movement were engaged by several opposing Tar Lords in an intensive educational effort among selected troops of Peng Yu-hsiang, Tchang-Tsoilin, Uu Pei-fu etc. The movement has now attained remarkable dimensions and the evening classes have been taken over by the provinces, counties, municipalities and local associations.
The leaders of this movement then decided to concentrate their efforts on discovering - by contact with the daily life and hardships of the Chinese farmer - the best methods for an educational effort which would raise

Accordingly, some fifty ex-university teachers and presidents took up quarters in an abandoned temple in a small locality north of Peiping on the road to the capital of Shensi. They proceeded to make a survey of demographic, economic, social and religious conditions, extending their area of study while remaining concentrated in one Hsien (county).
After two years of these efforts, they have gained the goodwill of the farming population, have established even-

societies, health officers, enginee the field. And all this in commandeering of supplies by
s and geologists in spite of train stoppages, the soldiery and the extreme
lisoomfort of living amongst the poor peasants during the severe winter months,
Our intention of visiting this station had to be abandoned, much to our regret; although we could have reached the locality (after 24. hours® railway travel in third-class carriages with broken windows!) we might have had to wait a fortnight for a return train, the roads being already impassable.
Dr. Tao Chin-sing has storied a less ambitious but no less interesting enterprise. He has established a "normal” teachers’ college, with 300 students, in a village near Nanking. His students have to board for six months with local families and live like them. He organised the farmers into a defence corps 200 rifles strong, to repel "brigands", and initiated a cooperative movement, an agricultural demonstration area, a health campaign, adult education and a model elementary and middle school - all in disused temples and compounds -the whole modest but efficient.
He were asked by the boys of his primary school to say a few words about the League, and complied. He were thai addressed for fieteen minutes (in Chinese) by a 12-year old boy, who gave an excellent account of the membership, constitution and principal achievements of the League!
He are only able to give impressions gained during a rapid voyage, but after consulting a number of responsible and independent Chinese and foreign observers, we cannot doubt the extent and driving force of this educational movement which aims at raising Hie standard of life of all those elements of the masses which are at present accessible.
Agricultural colleges (in Hangchow, 500 students) produce instructors for the "counties", schools for civil servants and local officials - and these future leaders of Young China are growing up and developing an abhorrence of civil war, readily renouncing their superstitions and pursuing aims for social and national emancipation’

institutes, the educational capacities of the graduates of the different training schools, he believe such a survey to he urgently required both for guidance by the Chinese themselves in framing policies, and as a basis for the study of the possibility of re?1 intellectual collaboration between the League and China.
Suitable
field for We cannot help feeling that in this field more promising League	and fundamentally important results may be achieved by
In telle otual'the League than in other domains where a national selection Cooperation.of public-spirited and devoted workers is less spontaneous.
Every year an increasing number of workers in the educational movement is produced by the foreign universities (mostly American or Americanised) while Chinese scholars are gaining increased experience as members of the teaching faculties of these Universities, which continue to supply Chinese professors for the national ins ti tutions.
Collaboration with the League in the educational field would not only be accepted - it would be welcomed wholeheartedly,¿provided it is sincerely intended to help China in her educational effort and not merely to secure a single scholar-politician as a member of the League’s Ccmmittee on Intellectual Cooperation. The results might be very considerable indeed - the infusion of modern ideas of international comity and the shaping of the mind of a new generation, which is seeking a philosophy, finding the vagueness of the "Three Principles of the People" hardly satisfying.
Two powerful appeals - the American and the Soviet -have been made to the mind of Young China since the war. Enthusiasm for America is noticeably cooling down; that for the Soviets, after the ruthless repression of various risings and the contact with the Russians, is now in a reflective mood. But one cannot help being impressed by the attraction which is still exercised by Russia, in spite of the Manchurian incident and in spite of the anticommunist "mot d’ordre". One is equally impressed by the desire to establish real contact with Europe. Tor New China, Europe, and especially Continental Europe and the nower European States - is closely identified with the League.
Link with
¡health.
Future health programmes will, we hope, be linked up with the educational movement, which appears to ns to be the most virile and universal agency. The health effort cannot stand alone - it represents only one phase of reconstruction, or of local administration or of social effort. It does not stand isolated even in ancient civilisations - in England it is based on local government; in Germany it derives its strength from social insurance; in Denmark and. Holland from the educational level of the population, and from rural cooperation.
18-
In China, it cannot he based on the medical profession nor on local administration, nor on the as yet inarticulate social effort, It might be connected with the Party. The thinking leaders of the Kuomintang studied the advisability of taking a leaf from the Militarists’ book and seeking local popularity by setting up baby clinics, dispensaries and people's hospitals.
But this would kill at its birth the incipient health effort (some of the leaders agreed with us on this point) by instituting the system of political appointments,by the low standard inevitably possessed by makeshift institutions, and by the practical impossibility of exercising critical or technical oontrol.
Hopeful prospects in spite of difficulties.
There remains only the vigorous educational movement which is continually devising new methods of protecting its institutions against interference and instability, which commands universal respect, and which has become a rallying point of genuine and public-spirited endeavour.
Thus there appears to be hope for the success of a plan of reconstruction. The logical foundation upon which to establish cooperation with the League exists in the universal desire for economic and social development, and the in the existence of onergetic teams of earnest Y/orkers.

Any such effort will have some further years of civil war to reckon with. The problem is, not how to stop war in order to start economic development, but how to engage in reconstruction while endeavouring to reduce internal hostilities to a minimum.
Hie first contact vithrealities in China resultsin a truly gloomy picture. As one travels and tries to understand the position, abundant cause is found for further deepening cf the gloom. But there emerges a realisation of the fact that a determined effort is being made to bring order out of what appears to be chaos; that material progress is undoubted and even rapid; that the effort will continue whatever may be the attitude of the foreigner, and that whoever will assist the small band of oouragecus reformers shall reap the moral benefits.
The Chinese attitude towards foreign powers and institutions will be determined by the degree to which their difficulties are understood and their efforts to overcome obstacles supported.

Itinerary.
During our stay in China vre visited in succession (either together or separately) Shanghai, hanking, Wusih, Shanghai, Hangchow, Tientsin, Peking, Shanghai, Tsingtao, Lairon, MuKden, Anuung, Tsmgtuc, Shanghai, .moy, Cunucn, Hongkong.
Everywhere we encountered the nest hospitable and friendly reception from the authorities, irrespective of the shades of their political opinions, and gained the definite impression that not only was the League's technical mission welcome but that there was genuine eagerness tc collaborate in health matters.
We may say at this point that we were deeply impressed by the	manner	in which last year’s visit of
M.' Avenol and M0	Bonnet	had furthered the cause	of the
League in China;	there	is no doubt that it was	this
influence that prompted	the Eoreign Minister to	refer	to
the League during the Manchurian crisis and to invoke its aid in the present sanitary reorganisation. It was due to the same influence that the Chinese Delegation to the Assembly was so carefully selected end included such influential personalities, Without this preparation of the ground effected by M. Avenol, the arrival of a League technical mission in China would have been viewed at least with suspicion.
We understood from the Minister of finance (end of December) that although he had not then been officially notified by the foreign Office, he was prepared to accept an arrangement by which the Chinese debt to the League would be paid off in twenty-five annual instalments, as discussed by M, A.venol with Mr. C.T. Wang.
As our stay in China lasted until the end of the year, we were obliged to relinquish the idea of returning to Europe via America; at least ton days would have been needed for useful work in Washington and New York, and we felt that at least one month was required in Geneva before the Health Committee session on March 5th. As this also prevented our re-visiting Japan, we made the suggestion to Professor Nagayo, the Japanese member of the Health Committee, and to Professor Miyajina, who was to represent him at the March session, that they might visit us in Shanghai; this suggestion was accepted. They received an official welcome from the Chinese Minister of Health on their arrival in Shanghai and subsequently visited Nanking. We are convinced of the extreme value of these contacts. They appeared to remove any hesitation in subscribing to the plan of collaboration proposed by the Chinese Government, as well as any doubts as to the timeliness of supporting Chinese national institutions rather than these established by foreign agency in China. Professor Miyajima assured us that he would support our plan of collaboration at the March session and intended to make a favourable report thereon to his Government.
Jo sent copies of the official correspondence with the Ministers of Health .and Education to M. Sugimura, with the request that he would consider the documents as a
personal communication in view of not be In your own hands for some

At Singapore we discussed Bureau with Dr. Gautier, and its
the work of our Eastern connection with our future
activities in China. Dr. Ouchi, the new Japanese Deputy Director, had taken up his duties a fortnight before our
arrival»
It will be possible for Dr, C-autier, in response to a request from the Chinese Minister of Health, to proceed to Shanghai this spring in order to assist in the campaign for mass innoculation agairst cholera and smallpox - a concerted action on the part of the Chinese and foreign authorities taken as a result of our consultations.

Stouman, who, >ur in tin our visit.

Professor Nagayo very reluctantly accepted our suggestion, which will be communicated officially to the Japanese Government, General Graham appeared much pleased with the tour of the Malaria Commission in India, and highly praised the technical ability and personal tact both of the chairman of the group (Professor Sohueffner) and of the secretary (Professor Ciuea); the latter had contracted malignant malaria during his travels but fortunately recovered in a few weeks’ time.
We arrived in Geneva on January 31st and the next day received a cable from the Chinese Minister of Health, stating that ho himself might not be able to attend the March session of the Health Committee - his Government, having
decided to proceed with the scheme
.tary reorganisation
without delay, insisted upon his remaining rormanently in th

capital. The name of Dr. Alfred Sze, Chinese Minister in London, was suggested as a substitute to attend the session.

I can well believe that the changes in the titles of League Committees are confusing and much of the confusion might be avoided if Sections would keep the point in mind.
I hardly think it practical to carry out the proposal that when a new Committee is set up its title
-p •H	ly fixed	by the	Council, ana	pG TO	o -rt g
of	ensuring	regular	ity would be	for	the

Sir Brie Drummond, Secretary-General,
League of Nations, GENBTA.
Sir,
Working at a distance from Geneva and, therefore, exclusively with documents, I have encountered a technical difficult’’ which would apparently be easily corrected by certain procedural formalities.
The great bulk of the League's work passes through committees, commissions or consultations. At the cutset, there is frequently indefiniteness or even confusion as to the accurate titles of these organs. According to my observation and experience, such confusion is essentially duo to the fact that the Council, in appointing or authorising the appointment of such bodies, does not regularly assign a definite name to the bodies contemplated. Council resolutions very carefully define the jurisdiction or * arrose cf such bodies, but usually omit giving a definite title to them.
As a consequence, there frequently occurs a variation of titular designation or even an inability to determine from the records what is the proper title of a given committee.	As an
instance, I refer to the resolution of the Council of September 28th, 1927, (Official Journal, Till, p.1455) where in establishing the organisation to carry out the recommendations of the International Economic Conference a Consultative Committee was provided for. In the interval since that resolution, that committee has been referred to in document both as the Economic Consultative Committee and Consultative Economic Committee, as well as Consultative Committee, illustrations could be multiplied.
These variations are not confusing at Geneva, where both the Secretariat and others are sufficiently familiar with the development of work to understand the distinctions between committees. Outside of Geneva, however, they tend to confuse.
I suppose that scarcely a week passes when I do not have to make an explanation of the nomenclature and division of work that has resulted from the changes that have taken place in what was originally the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Tomen and Children.
As the result of the development of Leag is work and the steadily increasing technical assignments to temporary bodies, this matter of committee nomenclature would seem to merit special attention. The suggestion that resolutions authorising the appointment of new bodies should contain, in addition to a definition of the body's jurisdiction, a clause specifying the name which it is to carry might be considered.
Yours very truly, (Signed) Denys P. Myers.

PROVISIONAL ESTIMAT!
"OR THE THIRTEENTH FINANCIAL
PERIOD (1931),
Note by the Treasurer.
The Treasurer has the honour to forward to Directors Chiefs of Sections and Heads of Departments the provisional estimates for the thirteenth financial period (1931).
These estimates which are based on the figures received from the Sections subject to such modifications as might be required as a result of the application of decisions of the Regrading Committeev have not yet been submitted to the Under Secretary-General in charge of internal administration or to the Secretary-General and as regards certain figures they are only approximate; they must therefore be considered as entirely provisional and strictly confidential.
Directors, Chiefs of Sections and Heads of Departments are requested to examine carefully the items and schedules in respect of the Sections and Departments which concern them, particularly with regard to the possibility of effecting economies, and to advise the Treasurer of any further modifications or corrections which they might still think it desirable to suggest.
The Secretary-General has expressed the desire to begin the examination of these estimates with the Directors concerned on Thursday March 20th.

South Africa has many important problems of
interest to the League; there is

the relation between the European and the clack in the cities, and communistic propaganda, the Indian question -happily calm at present largely through the statesmanship to bastri - the in .igration question and the
difficulty of Eur ope an c oun

the forth and Portuguese territory. It is frankly
pro oecoionist with insufficient markets in it
s own
borders "but determined on finding extensive markets elsewhere ; its economic development is enormous but agriculture is still burdened with excessive land values and lack of organisation. It has all the natural advantages of an industrial country with a daily developing market from the indigenous population increasing its standard of comfort, ard a fair chance of securing outside markets. It has an
excellent native labour supply and its agricultural and industrial development is certain. It is already the greatest gold and diamond producer in the world, and great hopes of immense output are expected from the copper belt in northern Rhodesia, the success of which will react throughout the whole of southern xfric There is practically no leisured class in South
Africa, unless the women form such a class, and it is true that the branches of the League of Rations Union are mainly composed of women members who have certainly not yet obtained, the success they deserve. This is perhaps due to lack of organisation as on the whole the spirit towards the League is excellent. General Hertsog expressed the belief that I should nuve the greatest assistance from the Dutch speaking residents, but this was not borne out by experience. hr. Smit, the Administrator of the Transvaal and la^e High Commissioner in London, was willing to bake an active part, but said lie was now losing touch, as the Provincial Library v. i not supplied with sufficient literature. On the whole, I came to the conclusion that if the Information Section decided to undertake
propaganda there, they «oula have the greatest success in reaching the public "by interesting the newspapers, the associated Chambers of Coronerce and the Chamber of . xnes. I found the greatest interest displace d by the notary Clubs and business men, particularly in the economic and Health fields, and among Government officials, who number about 115,000 and form an important proportion of the European population. It was pleasirg to observe, particularly at Capetown, the interest taken by High school teachers,
While the Information Section will find personal contact far more fruitful than the despatch of literature, they will see from the newspaper cutting, s that South Africa will rep; consider wnetner it .ould i more South African newspapers of the doings at Geneva; tl meagre and sometimes misles I think, after my visit, ti placing aeague literature throughout the country, ant free distribution must snow

La Haye, le 7 avril 1930
Cher Sir Eric,
Depuis m- dernière lettre, à laquelle vous avez lien voulu répondre avec une cordialité "bienveillante dont je vous remercie, les choses se sont gâtées gravement,
En effet, une pénible crise a éclaté à la Deuxième Commission; on renonce à établir l’étendue de la zone des eaux territoriales. Ce défaut d'entente sur le problème essentiel est à la base de la difficulté qu’on éprouve à mettre sur pied une convention qui ne comprendrait en tout cas que des points accessoires et secondaires A l’heure actuelle, (13 h. du ma.tin lundi 7 avril, Mr. Miller, premier délégué des Etats-Unis, a proposé qu’on renonçât à former une convention sur les eaux territoriales. ï£. Miller s été appuyé par l¿. Giannini (Italie), Rae s t ad (Norvège), Magalhaes (Portugal) et Brown (Royaume-Uni) en l’absence de Sir Maurice Gwyer,
Dans ces conditions, on peut d’ores et déjà prévoir qu’il ne sortira de cette Deuxième Commission qu'un rapport qui constituera l’accord sur certains points,
Meme crise, encore plus grave, à la Troisième Commission. Deux camps se sont formés, La majorité comprend la plupart des grandes puissances et la minorité voit dans ses rangs les Etats suivants : Mexique, Cuba, Uruguay, nicaragua, Salvador, Chili,
Pérou, Brésil, Roumanie, Tchécoslovaquie, Yougoslavie, Pologne, Dantzig, Chine, Perse, Colombie, Turquie, Lettonie, Portugal.
Etant donné l’importance de la minorité, il est à craindre ou bien que la Commission adopte deux textes s’inspirant chacun de principes diamétralement opposés (ce qui serait regrettable au point de vue codification) ou bien ou’il n’y aura pas de convention du tout.
Il nous reste encore la Nationalité. M. Politis vient de m’informer que la convention, qui comprend environ 17 articles et un texte complémentaire, a été adoptée à l’unanimité de 35 voix avec deux abstentions parmi lesquelles celle des Etats-Unis.
Malgré la mauvaise tournure des affaires, tous les membres du Secrétariat font de leur mieux pour aider à aplanir les difficultés.
Je regrette infiniment d'avoir à vous transmettre ces
nouvelles.
Croyez-moi, cher Sir Eric, votre dévoué.

Mr. Rodriguez will continue consulting his Latin-Amerioan colleagues oi the other Sections with regard to any unofficial letters which he may have to send to their respective countries, just as his colleagues should consult him concerning the communications, also unofficial, which they send to Panama.
2) I take this opportunity of informing all Sections that the Secretariat now has correspondents paid by the League in the following Latin-American States ;
Bolivia: Sr. Don J. A. Guerra, La Paz.
Costa Rica: Sr. Don Virriato Figueredo Lora,

There are various ways in which these correspondents might assist the work of sections, and I have no doubt that the Director of the Information Section who ensures the liaison with the correspondents will be happy to consider any suggestion to this e ffect.
The control exercised by the Information Section does not, of course, preclude the possibility of individual members of the Secretariat writing privately to, or receiving letters from, correspondents with whom they may oe personally

CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Memorandum to the Secretary-General,
I think it might he of interest in Geneva to have a few notes from the United States both as to conditions in general and the League of Nations in particular*
THE FINANCIAL CRASHc The one-outstanding, all-absorbing interest of the moment is the spectacular market collapse which began last Fall and unexpectedly recurred this Spring„ It has cut so desp5 has so wholly overturned the previous unbounded faith that America could not go wrong, that it has left the country bewildered, Whatever the causes, whether over-speculation, over-valuation, or what, the result has been to make America drawn in all along the line, to concentrate interest on self-preservation, to create a hesitancy and timidity. Stocks are tremendously low against values, dividend yields are high, hut people caught last Fall and again shaken this Spring are holding in. The results on foreign policy are obvious: concentration on other interests so that it is difficult to keep even a quorum in the Senate for the Naval Treaty Discussions, conservatism in financing abroad, and a deep threat and unreasoned resentment against what was expected to be the "Hoover Prosperity”. Amidst all the disagreement as to past and future, there seems to be one common point of accord: that recovery will be very, very slow, and that America will never mount as high as a short year ago.

THE TARIFF:	There are two factors about the
tariff which should be appreciated abroad^ The first is that is does not represent in any sense a national policy but rather the accumulation of a vast maze of selfish, individual interests operating for their own profit irrespective of national considerations» The tariff is drawn on what is called the n log-rolling” basis: that is* an industry in a certain locality wants protection; it goes to its Senator or Congressman and demands it as a price of continued support for re-election; that Senator or Congressman goes to other legislators in the same predicament and supports their industries in exchange for support for his* In other words, the tariff is drawn by men who care nothing about excluding, say, Swiss watches, but who care a lot about re-election. For a people proud of its economic efficiency, it is amazing that its foreign trade should be submitted to such a welter of selfish interests, whether of those seeking to make still more money or of those pushing their ownpolitical fortunes. The second element in the tariff situation is the extraordinary stress laid by all those surrounding the President on the flexible provision. Hot only did Mr. Hoover himself, on the day of signature, urge this as a corrective of the admitted evils of the bill but all those about him, whether Julius Klein, Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Dana Durand, chief statistician, or others, take the same line. The Tariff Commission is to be highly technical and expert, wholly non-political, ana, in the eyes of the Administration, will have power quinkly to undo some of the worst things that Congress has donea Congress undoubtedly did not mean this; it is even questioned if it will prove possible in practise; and, if it should, it is still more doubtful if Congress will continue to permit such a transference of powers, but for the moment,
3
it is the one hopeful sign which should he followed out to the fu11c Few defenders, indeed, has the present tariff; opponents and critics abound; there are even those who say it will be America’s last high tariff. It seems more likely, however, that, if prosperity returns, it will be forgotten; if not, it will be another charge to drive the Republicans from power.
PROHIBITION:	The change that has taken place through-
out the country as regards prohibition is almost revolutionary. Four or five years ago, yes, even three, the prohibitionists had complete control; to question prohibition was to be unsocial, almost immoral, Now the emphasis is all the other way: prohibition seems generally accepted, no matter how desirable it may have been and may still be, as a feLlure. Slowly, without single dramatic event or any one cause, a feeling seems to have grown up in the country, as subtly as moisten gathers to make a cloud, that prohibition as it now exists does not and cannot work, That is important to be realized abroad, however, is that prohibition is a vital and thought-consuming question in the United States; that the American people are trying to work their way through one of the most profound social reforms ever attempted; and that necessarily the time they can give to foreign affairs is seriously limited by the upheaval in their own midst,
THF HOOVER ADMINISTRATION:	It is doubtful if ever
an administration were elected with such high hopes as Hr,Hoover *s and within two years brought so low. A falling-off there always is in the second year but nothing comparable to what is now taking place. Seldom has a man entered the Thite House with such fair chances, such unparallelled prosperity, and such apparent abilities to increase it; never, I think, has any President had such a combination of ill-fsrtune as Mr. Hoover, with a bewildering
- 4 -
financial crash, where any efforts were pigmy indeed, and a surly, almost childish Congress ready to laugh its glee at any embarrassment it might cause the unorthodox man who had dared mount so high. The result is, however, that Mr. Hoover is under attach from all sides and that his prestige has dangerously waned.
His friends are desperate and on the defensive; his political opposition feel their chances were never so good; his personal enemies are having a field-day; Congress snipes at him at every opportunity, Meanwhile, however, M-r. Hoover keeps steadily on, apparently seeking a quiet and almost wholly unsuspected revolution in American government, He is refusing to do Congress' work for it but forcing responsibility on that body, and in the meantime is weaving a network of expert commissions and committees which, if it can be completed, will entirely change the face of the American political system, Entirely outside Congress, he has built up his Businessmen’s Commission to work on the economics cf the country; his Law Enforcement Commission to do what the law-making agency of the government should be able to do; his Tariff Commission to revise Congress’ tariff; and a host of others which, if fully launched, will transform the government. No one can yet say if he will have the opportunity to complete this fundamental work, either by a free hand the next two years or by re-election; the answer probably rests on the simple question of prosperity or no prosperity, where it certainly does not look hopeful. In any case, he has recently shown signs of reversing what many considered too great weakness towards Congress; he has accepted, and won, open battle on several questions, notably his veto of the first Veterans’ Bill and his refusal to see the Law Enforcement Commission hamstrung for lack of funds, even if it meant a public appeal. It is a fascinating battle on a vast and unchartable front, which will
5
have its effects not only within America hut throughout the outside world.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS: It is natural indeed that foreign affairs should have been relegated to a secondary place as a result of the dramatic events within the country. People have had little time to look abroad. Their first care has been their own safety in the financial disaster which has overtaken the country; their political instincts have been absorbed with the relentless conflict between President and Congress; their social consideration has been concentrated on the fundamental and now seething question of prohibition; their emotional interest has been glutted with Byrd’s return from the South Pole, the new style of reporting the "gunmen”, the breakfast-table question whether ’’The City of Chicago” were still in the air, etc. -urope sometimes forgets that America is a continent of its own: that a new, virile, dazzlingly rapidly developing lend has more than enough of interest within its own frontier without looking abroad to countries still prostrate from the war, and now, apparently, out of the line of danger interest» And yet America is more openly friendly, and less synically hopeless towards Europe, than at any time since the war. The Versailles Treaty fight has receded into memory; Europe has shown a good spirit in pulling itself over its most dangerous difficulties; America is undoubtedly more benevolent and, in the best sense, kindly. But the easing off of the emotional conflict towards Europe has undoubtedly had the effect of loosening the interest, of making Europe recede from the immediate foreground as an intimate American problem to a remoter background. Neither friendship nor hostility, therefore, run so deep as before. Occasional events, of course, bring Europe back to the front page, but only for a time. The London naval discussions, for
6

instance, brought a r&sh of interest but they have now lasted so Ion it is hard to keep public interest any nore, even to keep a Senate quorum. The tariff forced a consideration of foreign interests which, indeed, was more friendly and considerate than one would have expected, but that, too, passed. One sometimes wonders if the second post-war decade will not be the reverse of the first, that is, instead of America emotionally absorbed in Europe and Europe rather disdainful of America, the exact opposite may not take place and Europe turn her eyes westward while America is looking inward*?
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS:	The relaxation of American
interest in foreign affairs, and especially the cooling of the 1920 emotions, has inevitably had its effect on the status of the League of Nations in the United States. Changes have also occurred there, deep ones. The League is no longer the bugaboo it used to be to keep American nationalism awake o’nights, ex§ cept of course, for the very limited and dwindling group whose emotions are whipped by Senators Johnson and Moses, the Hearst papers, and the Chicago Tribune. Amidst the vast mass of the population, two elements seem to be accepted: first, that the League exists and is a beneficial agency for the other nations: second, that the United Stetes can usefully co-operate with it but will never be a member. American participation in League meetings seems now to be taken for granted in many widely different lines; the present flat rejection of membership need not be viewed any more tragically than President Uilson’s re-election in 1915 on the platform: "He kept us out of warn„
League prestige is high in the United States; its v/ork, even if not so ambitious as sometimes forecast, is respected; there are few who wish it positive evil. Occasionally, of course, it is used by the demagogues to frighten the public, as when the
7
London Treaty was opposed by the bugaboo of a "League Navy" or the sole ground of opposition to the Court is its relation to the League, but on the whole this form of indoor sport is rapidly losing cast. The respect which the European nations are showing the League and the dignity with which it has continued its development have won a corresponding respect in the United States. It may quite well be that this institution, which was once used to keep the United States away from Europe, may be the best asset in bringing back its useful co-operation; that in fact, as Mr. Root has said, it may prove to be Europe’s strongest diplomatic card in dealing with this country of the West. Still under the surface as yet, this feeling is gaining ground in the United States; there is, indeed, a very noticeable shift in the private talk of League friends. While, for the moment, everything is in suspense on account of the Naval Treaty and the Court, while the whole League issue is being left quiesce till these two matters are settled now, for the first time since 1920, one finds an impatience with the policy of indirect approac to the League and a consideration of whether direct action would not be better, after all. This is as yet but embryonic but it is none the less significant. Many there are who are becoming weary of side-paths supposed to lead in a roundabout fashion to Geneva, Kellogg Pact, Court, arms embargo, etc., and ure asking if it would not be better to face the main question straightway. Secretary Kellogg is reported as contemplating direct espousal of the League; McDonald of the Foreign Policy Association, who formerly leaned oxrer backwards to avoid League propaganda, has now come out straight for membership; Shotwell add many others are working to the same line. It may be sometime before this movement fructifies, certainly not till after the Naval Treaty and the Court matter are settled; in the
8
meanwhile, towever, it is well to continue the quiet laying of the foundations and to recognise that, sooner or later, America MUST squarely face the question of its relationship, its formal relationship, to the one osganised association of nations.
THE STATE DEPAPTMEMT: The State Department increases in friendliness and knowledge with each year that passes« Continued improvement was noticeable this Spring through the experience of several officials at the London Conference; participation by Hackworth and Flournoy of the Solicitor’s office in the Codification Conference and recent visits to Geneva of Gilbert, of the Western European Division, McDermott, head of the Press Section, and McClure of the Treaty Division. A rather surprising number of officials have now had contact with League work; their difference in attitude in comparison with those who have not is really extraordinary, 'There can be but little doubt but that the Department will do whatever it can, without political difficulty, in furthering friendly relations with the League; there have been too many recent indications of that fact to admit of doubt; and the recent sending to the Geneva consulate of Gilbert, one of the older officials of the Department, is further proof of Interest, 'Chat must never be forgotten, however, is that there is always danger of an explosion by the small but voluble opposition; that its is desirable to proceed cautiously and on the surest of foundations, and that too great haste might jeopardize what has already been built. For the moment, then, there are limits to American co-operation, but within those limits an ever increasing friendliness and effectiveness may be expected.
THS CCURT:	The biggest single issue of League interest
is, of course, the Court. There cannot be the slightest doubt
9
"but that there has been a big majority in the ben ate for approval of the Protocol for American accession ever since it was signed last September, but the Administration has not deemed it opportune to precipitate the bitter controversy which would surely develop, until the Naval Treaty is out of the way.
No one ever dreamed the naval matter would drag so long; perhaps if they had, Court action would have been taken sooner; and there are undoubtedly high officials who now regret the delay and feel it was a mistake* However, it has been done in the best of faith, as a matter of political strategy, and criticism is useless. Unfortunately, however, Court support is weakening somewhat; the matter cannot cone up till the December session, and there will certainly be a very bitter fight. If the Administration is free to put all its strength behind it, the Court will win; if it is halfhearted or hobbled by other difficulties, it is doubtful.
In either case, the other nations can afford to wait - with the knowledge, which fully justifies the bitterness of the opposition, that this battle means far more than the Court itself and is the beginning of the end of the main League fight.
-10-
The COURT ECMIEATIOESz The American Group this year faced a doubly difficult situation; first, where before there viere no candidacies at all, this year there were many, with very earnest supporters and even, in one case, with a magnifioaatly printed circular in English and French erMently sent broadcast. Secondly, there was no one individual, suoh as Mr. Hughes last time, who stood out sharply as possessing all the qualifications desired, especially the new ones of two languages and permanent serviceo As the question began to be considered, also, it seemed to be increasingly the opinion of the two who were available,
Messrs Rootbaker, that, with the Protocol soon to come before the Senate, it was essential this year to nominate someone who would carry with him a wide national prestige and popularity. With Messrs Wickersham, Howton Baker, and John Yk Davis unavailable, the tendency at the moment of writihg was strongly for Mr. Kellog, who, it ©as understood, was willing to accept, and who, despite his 73 years, was considered to have both the judicial equipment and the personal prestige desirable here and abroad. Mr. Kellogg, it was thought, might step into the emergency during the next critical years, after which perhaps a younger and more purely juridical man might be chosen.
CODIEICASIOlis The Hogue Codification Conference, while sometimes viewed in Europe as a failure, stood surprisingly well in the state Department, The Solicitor, Mr. Hackworth, had written a very friendly report to Mr Ctimson on the Responsibility matter, saying that, while perhaps the positive results were not so great as hoped, the indirect results were of the utmost value in that, on the one hand, a very large measure of agreement was secured amongst 'the older states, end on the other, the participants had secured a personal knowledge of each other and each otherrs
-11-
views which would immeasurably advance all their many future negotiations on these difficult questions. Mr. Flournoy was also pf opinion that the Nationality discussions had been vwrtr while and is now urging signature of one of the Conventions.
Both agreed, as did Mr. Wiokersham, American member of the original expertsT Committee, that the work would continue, though perhaps next time it might be wiser to select subjects of less vital concern to governments and carry their preparation further by expert, non-governmental committees. Beyond the immediate matters involved, however, came one of major principle, that is, that while the United States has made "codifioation" a major policy and attended the recent Conference with Congressional approval, it will have no voice whatsoever in the Assembly discussions this year when the whole future international policy in this matter will be laid down. Department officials thoroughly appreciate this handicap involved in America's general relationship to the League; Mr, Wicker sham has already begun 4isoussing nith Mr. Stimson whether something might not be done to give the United States a voice in these discussions, as was done t;1isa the league invited the government to send a delegation to the Assembly in connection with the Opium discussions, as was done.
DISAEMâlvïSID: While, naturally, the London Treaty is absorbing the major interest in Washington, State Department officials are closely following the developments of the land problem and the prospects of the Preparatory Commission and ask quite frankly if there is any way in which they can be of service. They are obviously disturbed about the possibilities, and while outside the immediate issues, are anxious to give any help
-12-
they can. Vf.ith this thought, a Department official will be in Geneva at the triune of the Assembly to see ¿us t how the Franco-ltalian discussions have progressed and to attempt to forecast a helpful policy for the American delegation in Novembero While the Franco-Italian difficulty seems the most specific and the general land problem very confused, perhaps chief concern is felt about the air, which seems in Washington a wholly unexplored, mass»
SERIAL COQPDIMIOIt In this connection it is satisfachory to be 'able to report complete American co-operation in the new League Committee on Aerial Co-ordination, which might so (Levelope as to bring to the League the whole air problem.
Col, Lindbergh gladly consented to co-operate with other
fliers in submitting a statement for the Committee*s documentation*
the State Department, after consultation with other interested
departments, was preparing to nominate a representative to
the Committee«. This work could be developed to enormous American
inter est «
OPIUMs American policy towards the opium problem should change materially with the sudden death of Mr* Porter.
For years now, this has been a personal oampaign of his own, being able as he was through his chairmanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to lay down whatever policy he chose.
That policy, as it happened, differed from the Leagued in stressing control of production rather than manufacture, and smoking and eating opium in the East rather than using it as a drug in the West. The State Department has not followed all his views but has pretty much been confined to a policy of inaction
-13-
because of them and of his control of the Foreign Affairs Committee, There would seem reason now to hope for fuller and mere active oo-oporation in the programme the League has laid down«
HEALTHt The LeagueTs Health work enjoys high repute in the United States, notably in the Rockefeller Foundation which io now granting it some ^142,000 a year for five years and whose medical Director expressed deep appreciation
and interest.
m attempt to strengthen .American representation
on the Committee by appointment of a high government official failed, however, largely for fear of rousing political opposition; but further representation will probably be had in addition to the valuable technical services of the Surge on-G-eaeral of the United States, long a member of the Committee, Undoubtedly, interest has bean piqued, and some opposition aroused, by the League rs health work in lab in-America, where the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau has generally been thought sufficient,
TRAFFIC IN WOMENS The misunderstanding which developed as to the organisation and personnel of the Far Eastern Inquiry
seems to have been straightened out, so far as the main Rockefeller interests are concerned, by the formula approved by the May Council, but there are undoubtedly certain personal and administrative difficulties which persist with the technical agencies, Closer lishon, especially in the immediate sending of all documents, is high].;/ desirable.
INTELLECTUAL CO-OPERATION:	The reorganisation
of the LeagueTs work on intellectual co-operation has been followed with the closest interest in American intellectual circles, where it has always been hoped that some method of useful
-14-
collaboration might be found but where the specific ways have never seemed to present themselves. Dr. Duggan had sent back most optimistic reports from the Experts' Committee of which he was a member; the members of the American national Committee seemed well informed and interested, certain Rockefeller officials were anxious for the latest developments, and Messrs. Vernon Kellogg and J. David Thompson were leaving for Geneva for th? plenary committee. There are souroes of help to be tapped here, if the right scheme of co-operation can be found.
AGRICULTURE:	The government, much against its
wishes, still feels that the Institute of Agriculture is not sufficiently international and not sufficiently technical, and has recently set in motion trhat may be a far-»reaching project for gathering the statistics and information which it feels the Institute should have gathered. This breadh is unfortunate, for it results in one nation doing for itself what all should do for each other, but there seems no way of changing the government’s policy unless the institute itself changes. At the moment there is an appropriation of some $350,000 for a series of agricultural Commissioners abroad, who will provide a world service to Washington and build up nationally what should be international. Meanwhile, the co-operation with the League's Agricultural Committee has been well received .and it would seem as though some -way should be found to heal the Breach between Washington and Rome.
BUOYAGE AUD LIGHTING QE COASTS: The House has just passed a resolution authorising American representation at the Lisbon Conference in October, and, whether the Senate has time before adjournment to do the same, an American official delegation will undoubtedly be present.
-15-
STATISTIC3 CONVENTION:	An if fort will shortly
be made to have this convent ion signed by the United States as marking a valuable forward step in international statistics, CUSTOMS N CON CL AT URS:	Interest was expressed in
this work, where it is obviously desirable that unification in Europe and in America proceed as nearly as possible along the same lines, and some surprise wa3 felt that the United States had not been kept more in touch with developments. There is everything to gain on both sides by co-operation.
PRESS CONFERENCE:	An eoho of the Press Conference
came with the statement by Mr. Biokel, President of the United Press, that that vjas the most useful meeting he ever/attended, that the whole foreign work of his organisation had been changed by it, and that he was ready to go to another whenever and on whatever subject the League might call it.
EUROPEAN JOURNALISTS:	The 14 European journalists
invited by the Carnegie Endowment, with the help of Geneva authorities, for a two-months tour of the United States, report an invaluable experience. They had gone from one end of the country to the other and have much in mind to make Europe better informed of the United States.
THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR:	Officials of the 1933
World's Fair in Chicago had suggested the possibility of the League exhibiting. Rufus Dawes, manager in the absence of his brother in London, thought there might be difficulties in a formal invitation through the government but stressed the interest of an exhibit on social matters, for instance health.
GENEVA RESEARCH INFORMATION COMMITTEE:	The formation
Of a group of Americans in Geneva to furnish, first, a monthly resume of four pages on League activity, and second, a monthly
-15-
research on some particular subject of league activity especially interesting to Americans, was received with the deepest interest in many quarters, where it was felt that ju§t such a thlhg had long been wanted and that it oould not but be of the greatest value to the spreading of league information amongst newspapers, universities, groups, and individuals. Subscriptions to the service Ire certain; financial support is very possible.
PUBLIC IlPOPlLMl01: Public information in regard to the League is spreading noticeably. The World Peace Foundation reports that the sale of League publications is greatly increasing, and that no less than 82 libraries subscribe to the Global Service at a cost of $150 annually» In addition the government has purchased 22 sets of the Treaty Series to distribute in its missions abroad and will eventually come to double that number.
She great difficulty now is underprinting at Geneva of certain documents; the new Key just published in Boston is expected to be a great stimulant to sales. A tremendous, but unseen, education is going on in the colleges and Universities, the League of Nations Association, for instance, reporting the participation of 5300 students from 35 States in over 44 model Assemblies last year. Likewise, league organs are strengthening, the League of Nations Chronicle of the Midwest Office of the National Association sending its editor to Geneva for six months. The wall which ignorance and prejudice allowed to be built against American understanding of the League is slowly but surely being undermined ,,-by a widespread national education which goes further, probably, than in any state member of the League, except perhaps, England.

LEAGUE CF NATIONS,
Confidantial Circular .10.1930. REPRESENT AT I ON OF STATES MEMBERS ON LEAGUE C0LHITIE5S.
Note by toe Secret ary-Oeneral.
A feeling, which seems to me to be somewhat justified, is growing up among the various states members of the League thht they are rather neglected in the different League Committees, and that representation on these Committees is always confined to a very limited number of states.
I have received representations, for instance, from Hungary that they have practically no members on any League Committee, and other Governments have indicated a similar view.
I think that it would be wise if the various Sections concerned would consider the situation as regards those Committees for which they are responsible, and perhaps a first and desirable step would be if M. Sugimura would ask a member of his Section to tabulate the number of nationals of the various members of the League included in league Committees.
It seems also possible that the question of the term of office of members of League Committees will be raised at the Assembly. It might, therefore, be useful if simultaneously a paper were drawn up, shewing the eais ting situation as regards the method of appointment and the duration of the term of office of members of League Committees. M. Sugiarira has designated Major Abraham for the study in question, and I should be glad if all Sections oould give him any help or information he may ask for.
