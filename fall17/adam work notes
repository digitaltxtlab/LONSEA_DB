Workflow 25/8:

Formed lon_data into five_nat.df consisting 5 regions: Scandinavia, South American, French, Swiss, British
In this process, dual double nationalities are united, and spelling mistakes are corrected i.e. "SwissFrench" -> "Swiss, French"
Problem: begin dates before 1919 -> are removed

Scripts for initial plots made: Bar diagrams of member distribution as well as density/proportion plots.

Created a better data frame: nation5.wo_temp.W_GA_rank.csv
Elaborate name: data frame of 5 nations, without temporary worker, with general assembly and their fname_code rank added as a column.

Remade the analysis from yesterday with general assembly, i.e done rank/nationality/division analysis on this data set. Script for this is career.dev.5nationalitis.

Made slow code for converting employment intervals into a  employee/work period matrix. The matrix consists of all months from 1919-01-01 to 1948-12-30. A number indicates the rank that the person had this month. A member just need to have been hired for 1 day of the month to be noted. If a member had multiple ranks during the period itâ€™s the latest that is assigned. This is done in employment_interval_df.R
